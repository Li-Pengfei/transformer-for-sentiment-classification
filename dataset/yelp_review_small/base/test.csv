4,"quiessence is , simply put , beautiful .   full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm .   the restaurant seemed fairly full even on a tuesday evening ; we had secured reservations just a couple days before . 

 my friend and i had sampled sandwiches at the farm kitchen earlier that week , and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant .   the crisp , fresh veggies did n't disappoint : we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start .   both were very good ; i did n't even know how much i liked raw radishes and turnips until i tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces . 

 for entrees , i ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder .   service started out very good , but trailed off quickly .   waiting for our food took a very long time ( a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our 's ) , and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later .   apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree , so he started anew .   this is n't really a problem , but they should have communicated this to us earlier .   for our troubles , they comped me the glass of wine i ordered , but they forgot to bring out with my entree   as i had requested .   also , they did n't offer us bread , but i will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out : ask for the bread .   we received warm foccacia , apple walnut , and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter .   yum . 

 the entrees were both solid , but did n't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables .   my lamb 's sauce was delicious , but the meat was tough .   maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go ?   but our dessert , the gingerbread pear cake , was yet another winner . 

 if the entrees were tad more inspired , or the service were n't so spotty , this place definitely would have warranted five stars .   if i return , i 'd like to try the 75 $ tasting menu .   our bill came out to about 100 $ for two people , including tip , no drinks ."
3,"there 's two ways to look at this place . one is getting quality food at a good price . the other is getting a lot of food for a cheap price . i prefer the former but those who prefer the latter wo n't agree with my review . 

 i thought the scramble i had was okay but nothing fantastic . i definitely did n't care for the biscuits . the food was n't health conscious at all but if you 're looking to fill up with calories and get a good - sized portion then this is your type of place . also , i am not a fan of the diner - type ambiance ... i would rather have something with more character but i 'm glad i tried this place out ."
4,"they must have renovated this place in the last year . it is now spacious and airy and there is no longer the dreaded "" hover over a table to get a seat "" necessity .   it now reminds me much more of the dreaded "" panera bread "" chain in california , but the food is still much better and has much less of a "" mass produced "" feeling and taste . 

 the service ( management , staff etc ) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared . 

 i love carbs ... carbs with carbs and a side of carbs .   they serve warm syrup with their pancakes ( yum ! ) and their bread is just amazing .  

 the "" side of pancakes "" is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent , fluffy , and tasty .  

 they offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness ( cinnamon , nutmeg , cocoa ) to top it off just right . 

 today , before returning to the land of freeways and smog and eternal sunshine(well , the other land of that anyway ) we enjoyed their peppermint hot chocolate . i would highly recommend that you run on it and have this frothy goodness before the holiday season ends !"
4,"this place just opened up next to the salon i work in . amazing ! they hit the ground running , 

 it 's a deli style , where you order at the counter and they bring you the food . i had the grayhawk turkey club and the turkey was great ! no packaged crap here . it was thick sliced and probably rotisserie . for the side i had sweet potato tater tots . delish ! the have regular fries , sweet fries , tater tots , onion rings , etc . 

 great looking salads , chicago - style dogs , gourmet burgers and yummy sounding mac and cheese . 

 the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price . it 's great for dinner , but a little steep for a work day lunch ."
4,"this would most certainly be "" my "" coffee shop if i had n't already established myself as a regular at another local shop . this brand - new , independent coffee shop has spent the money to look really nice ( it even has a fountain inside ! ) . 

 but what money ca n't buy is community and unfortunately this shop does n't seem to have much of that . granted , building community takes time and/or energy . for their sake , i really really hope it works out in the long - run ."
4,"went back to ab a few weekends ago , again for brunch , with a large group .   i was surprised to see that , although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends , they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items .   the people that i invited that had never been to ab before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since i 'd told them that they had great brunch , but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody marys and some good ( if not diverse ) food .   i had the egg sandwich sans bacon again ( excellent again ) and sweet pea and i split the french toast as well .   we 'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening , so we did n't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries , in addition to the syrup .   if you come here for brunch and like french toast , you have to try it .   it 's the best french toast i 've ever had , and many at our table agreed .   the secret is that they bread it in cornflakes .   yum .   and , the bloody marys are in the excellent range , i 'd say just below the phenomenal ones at dick's / rokerij .   the service was also friendly and quick ."
4,this is a little hockey dive - bar located in the arcadia area .   tv screens hang above the bar & as you look behind the bar you can see the hockey rink and players .   enternaining as the other review said .   i had dunkel hefeweisen and my girlfriend had a corona .   good times as a group of kids played rock band and sang off - key nirvana covers .   i like this little hidden place .   just be prepared - it 's your average little bar for the average joe guy .
3,great food and awesome service ! even better that the chef came out and personally checked on our experience . i will be back for more delicious bbq
4,"sacks is a different kind of sandwich shop . they have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos , fresh spinach , grilled peppers , and all sorts of other things you do n't see at a typical deli . then they serve it up on a baguette , wrap , or wheat bread for about $ 6 . the specials are particularly diverse and change daily . on the other side of the coin , their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right , but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy . ( we get a weekly sacks delivery . ) 

 if you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich , you can get that here . if you want a sandwich like their blue bayou , which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon , bleu cheese crumbles , cheddar jack , mushrooms , spinach , and chipotle mayo , all melted down , well , you can get that here too , but only on the days when it 's a special . 

 from their regular , artist - inspired menu , their dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad : this one comes with lettuce , bacon , cream cheese , mayo , and tomato , on 12-grain bread . the encore has prime steak , melted provolone , hot / mild / or mixed peppers , feta yogurt or marinara sauce , lettuce , tomato , and parmesan for $ 6.30 . seriously , give this place a shot and you wo n't be disappointed . 

 oh , and every sandwich comes with a lovely cookie . brilliant ."

4,"my husband and i went here on a saturday night for dinner because we had a restaurant.com gift certificate . yes , it 's in the sheraton , and yes it 's near the airport with not much else around , but i have to say- we were both impressed . 

 we started with the gambas al fuego , which were deliciously spicy ( although i thought that $ 10 for four shrimp was a bit excessive , no matter how tasty they were ) . we both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- i think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads . they used fresh field greens , the tomatoes were perfect and sweet , and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious . the blue cheese dressing was fantastic , and had actual chunks of blue cheese . i was impressed , for a hotel restaurant . for our entrees , i had the hickory smoked baby back ribs ( good , but not phenomenal ) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- i am so glad he shared a bite with me , because it was awesome . i was really wishing i 'd gotten that instead of the ribs . oh , and i especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender , cooked just right , and flavorful . this place uses quality ingredients . 

 if it was n't so out of the way , we would definitely come by regularly . my husband was especially enticed by the prime rib melt sandwich , so i think we 'll be back during lunch in the near future . 

 the only reason i 'm not giving 5 stars was that the atmosphere was pretty dead . which i suppose is understandable , given that it 's inside the sheraton . the decor was nice though . they should have a free standing restaurant in an area with more traffic- this place would be a hit ."
5,very friendly and knowledgeable guys .
3,"came for a friend 's birthday and really was not that impressed . first of all , it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back . on saturday if you are there before 7 pm , all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special . we ate dinner there and the menu was very limited . the food was okay , but our burgers were over cooked . the service was slow and it took us a while to get our check . i 'd go to hang out again and have a few drinks , but i would n't suggest making this your regular hang out ."
5,"i have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet .   good food , good service ; no complaints .    still have never made it here for happy hour , but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal .   the staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another .   i 've only ever eaten sushi here , but they have a lot of other menu items that i would like to try at some point , but i always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh .   i would recommend trying this restaurant ."
3,affordable and good .   clean restaurant .   will return .
3,"service was faster than some of the other ( but better ) indian restaurants i have been to in the area . the food was so - so . nothing special . i enjoy spicy indian food , but the "" hot "" was not . the only reason we ate there was the buy one get one free in the phoenix area coupon book ... no that , was a good value ."
3,"no frills .   nothing fancy .   just some honest burritos and tacos .   voted "" best taco "" by new times a few years back ( in the 90 's ) .   not sure i agree , but they consistently satisfy .   they make a hearty breakfast burrito too .   if you 're looking for sonoran or tex - mex or anything beyond what you might find at filiberto 's , try somewhere else .   the red burro combo is my personal favorite .   it 's saucy ( enchilada style ) and just spicy enough .   bottled beer available ."
2,"so , i went because of all the hype . immediately , realized how overrated it was . the ambiance is like a chilis but trying to be mexican ."
4,"gils .. a relatively new business to the complex on 16th st and bell rd . 

 gils is not your average mexican style food . it is new mexican style . they use whole beans , no lard and light on flavor . the rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused . the burritos are covered in red or green sauce , which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop . 

 i had the pork carnita 's burrito topped with green sauce . beans and rice . i would have been disappointed it i expected smashed refried beans too . but i love the beans as they are . they are sort of like a ham hock style bean . the carnitas was wonderful and huge . filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it . topped with cheese and hatch green chilie sauce . did i mention huge ? 

 the whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $ 10 bucks . i even have a small lunch for tomorrow . the chips are homemade and the thicker type . the red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good . 

 the rest of the menu looked good , nothing stood out as a must have but i will be back . 

 the place was clean and they made a nice patio outside , complete with waterfall and everything ."
1,"what a load of absolutely hideous , uninteresting crap . 

 take every single one - star review written by yelpers below , copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything i can come up with . 

 i have no reason to ever come here . certainly not free will . the one time i did come here i was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend ."
4,"this is a tough one .   i 'd found out about mrs. white 's by way of lo - lo 's , and thought i 'd try mama 's food before son 's .   it was good , i 'll say that .   i had the smothered chicken and regretted it immensely - fried chicken covered with gravy amounts to a mess of watery breading .   between that and having to dig through the mess to find the bones , it was n't exactly a lot of meat down my throat .   mac & cheese and white rice as my sides were good . 

 the ambiance ?   there is none .   i found more entertainment from the writing on the wall , which had clearly been painted over many times since the 60s , and the open / close sign which reads , if closed , to contact "" jesus "" .   lol . 

 unaware of the church across the street , i arrived right after sunday services to find the place fairly full - some churchgoers , at least one newcomer party , and several regulars .   based on the caloric content of the entrees , i was n't surprised to see about 50 % obese customers , while the rest were inexplicably thin . 

 as a whitey , i ca n't say that i was comfortable .   clientele is almost all black and while they are some of my best friends , i only felt welcome because of the cordial words spoken by our waiter and the cashier at the checkout , who clearly could have beat the crap out of me with one punch .   other than that , there were a lot of "" what are you doing here ? "" looks from fellow customers .   i kept wishing i had brought my sista friend with me , who would have loved this place . 

 i 'd go back , but it 's not a perfect choice .   perhaps on a saturday when church had n't just let out .   also , the price is extreme - it 's almost as high as knott 's berry farm which gives you more food for only about $ 2 more , and that 's at theme park prices .   this is just dumpy outskirts of downtown .. but again , i do n't wanna judge .   i love small business and i 'm proud of mrs. white for making it this long ; hope she continues for a long time to come ."
4,"had the place to ourselves on a thurs nite ( 5/19 ) so ... service great , mgr came over and asked if we had eaten here before "" nope "" so he said he wanted to buy dessert , "" great , thank you "" oreo cheesecake was good ... now .... pizza ... pricey by 2 - 4 bucks but was very good . ca n't go wrong with your toppings but the riccotta was not my cup of tea ( wife liked it on her pizza ) . definetly going back to try it again ... great crust"
1,"i had not been to an oregano 's in like 10 years . they seems to be popping up all over here in az now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try , so why not . 

 i 'll tell you "" why not "" ... we has two thin crust pizzas ... and i even hate to call them that . more like ... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings . 

 that was some of the worst excuse for pizza i 've ever had . most of the fast - food delivery pizza i 've had beats it -- and i do not like , at all , delivery pizza . 

 maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust ... god it could not be worse ! 

 it only deserves one star for the good service ... other than that is the another sub - par overpriced "" gourmet "" pizza joint . 

 if you want expensive , and good , pizza there are many good alternatives ... pizzeria bianco , grimaldi 's , etc ."
1,"i recently had a shit cleaned at the intercontinental hotel in hong kong . not cheap . i only mention that because this place charged more to clean that suit - almost $ 30 for a two - piece suit after they tacked on their $ 6 "" designer brand "" surcharge ( no , i am not kidding ) . despite branding as "" green "" the suit still reeked of solvent ( the green , silica - based solvents have never left an odor in my experience ) . no differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area . be warned !"
4,"this place is wonderful ! the service is amazing and food is delicious . 

 i especially enjoyed the clams oreganato appetizer .  

 the eggplant parm lunch special came with pasta and choice of soup or salad .   what a great deal !"
5,we started each morning of our vacation at the breakfast club .   everything was so tasty ; juices are fresh - squeezed .   menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling   it gets busy early .   be sure to give it a try .
3,the server could have been better . she spilled a coke on my lap . this made me late for my movie . the wait was so - so however the food was cooked to my liking . i will go back .
3,"i had a hankering for raw fish today and decided to give moto a try .   overall i was pleased . 

 the menu had a wide variety of tempting asian treats but i was here for fish , so i ordered the sashimi combo with a bowl of miso . 

 the soup was a bit odd .   it seemed to be normal miso soup with some shredded cabbage tossed in .   the cabbage added a texture that i did n't really want but it was easy to eat around it . 

 the presentation of the sashimi was interesting .   i had a pinwheel of fishy goodness with yellowtail , smoked salmon and tuna .   the fish tasted quite fresh and the portions were generous . 

 when i need a sushi fix for lunch i 'll be returning to moto ."
5,"the food was flavorful and plenty of it . eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud . my girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage / carrots . it all had kind of sweetish / bitterish / spicy flavor . i had the lamb and jalapeño dish , which was kind of greasy . you eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe , which goes well with the food . i 'd be happy to go back and try something different .   if you are used to frozen pizzas and burger king , you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume ."
4,"yum ! 
 steaks were great ! corn bread 

 large portions 
 definitely worth the price !"
3,i much prefer drinking here to eating here .   sometimes it is the only place close and i decide to order food and i always regret it .   i 'm a vegetarian so maybe i 'm too limited and the burgers are awesome    so stick to traditional fare .   the salads my daughter and i had yesterday were pathetic
4,"brought my car in to get the electric stuff checked . $ 25 to do an electronic systems check , then determined it was a bad alternator . i brought my car in at the end of the day , about 5 pm or so , and they had it ready by 11 am the next day . 

 the owner / manager , terry , seemed like a straight up guy . pricing is fair , as far as i could tell . 

 they seem to stay pretty busy with normal cars as well as business fleet vehicles . i 've seen school buses there , topkick - sized trucks , and as well as your standard fare trucks with lawnmowers on the back ."
3,"i had been craving sushi steadily for about two weeks , so i decided to try somewhere new . this place happens to be just across the street from my work and the reviews on here were a vote of confidence . 

 i had the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll , shared edamame , and hot green tea . the cherry blossom roll was good , not amazing , but good . the fish was fresh enough , and i did like the eel sauce drizzled on it . the rainbow roll was much less rainbow than i 'm used to . the rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste , and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color , and not as moist as it could have been . the crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish . the edamame was tasty , not over cooked , but could have used a little more salt . the green tea was boiling hot , with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea , i was disappointed it came in a single glass , not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants . 

 my girlfriend had pork katsu , the sauce drizzled on it was sweet and vinegary , but not too overwhelming . gauging from the fact that she ate all of it i would assume it was pretty good . the salad that came with it was a bit strange , iceberg lettuce and a cream sesame dressing . the miso soup on the side was better than the little packets i get at the store , but did n't taste home made . it was not too salty , but the tofu must have been dehydrated , it was in tiny little shriveled squares on the bottom of the bowl . 

 the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly . it was n't too busy when we went , about 5 pm . the music was typical pop music , but thankfully unlike some places ( ra for instance ) its not blaring . 

 i would say its definately not the best sushi i 've ever had , not even the best i 've had in arizona , but it was ok . the rainbow rolls at kobe are better ."
3,"meh . 

 plus for cool decor . minus for being in a strip mall ( but hey it 's phoenix ... ) 

 cinnamon roll was good .   awesome icing . toluca brizza was unique , but nothing spectacular . 

 it would be a good place for groups , with a vast menu ( that i hear is very vegan friendly ) , but they are better places around town for brunch , both in terms of quality and price points ."
3,good destination for pizza . would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when i worked in the area . nice new york style pizza with a crisp crust .
4,"if you need something obscure , or you need to get everything you need in one place , then here you go .   i also love how many different 1 shot mini bottles bevmo has to choose from ."
5,"i am a huge suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the suns have to offer as well as their back - office staff . 

 first and foremost , talk about a professional , classy organization . whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice , the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with . my contact is kyle pottinger and he is always a gentleman . no matter what questions i have , he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like i 'm bothering him . 

 the fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who does n't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets ? 

 the process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with . the suns will treat you professionally and courteously . you wo n't be disappointed ."
5,"i love boba drinks but hate the word "" boba "" . i always feel like an ape when i say that word . 
 
 anyways . 

 there was a period where i use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when i was living in san francisco , so when i say i love something , i really do ( or is it more like a creepy obsession ? ) so ! when i found a boba place here i got excited , especially when i saw that they had green milk tea . 

 i ca n't vouch for all of their drinks , as i 've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow , but every time i have ordered them they have been super good ."
5,"my fiance and i went here today for the first time . we shared a meat pie 
 and a serving of the largest   bosnian sausage dish . 
      all of it was amazing . i can not speak highly enough of their food . service was very prompt and the waitress courteous and quick . the food was very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was very charming and nicely decorated . all over , the ambiance was pleasant . i look forward to returning !"
4,"i read that the guy who owns godaddy shot an elephant ... at night ... using spotlights ... i'm thinking his fully tumescent "" manhood "" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin ... i ca n't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered / laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away , while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare . 

 there was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer , when i was a kid back in oregon ... ""asshole "" . 

 he did prove to me that i will need to move any and all business i can away from godaddy ... ""vote with your feet"" ... but i guess that 's another review . 

 the beautiful carin and i were in scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us ! 

 at the very tippy top of the "" near and dear "" list is our lovely daughter , whitney . 

 whit is a vegan ... with a capital "" vege"" ... and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an african elephant by some dot bomb misogynist . 

 so she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to green for dinner ... an experience so very alien to me that i made carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me ... just in case ! 

 i am not a vegan ... i was born and raised on a cattle ranch ... i do love a good medium rare rib - eye ... i do n't think it hurts elsie the cow to have a teat twiddled so i can have cream in   my coffee or cheese on my burger ... and yet , the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart ! 

 i checked yelp and saw that while my vegan friends on yelp love this place , my decidedly carnivorous yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that green is foodgasm inducing ! 

 we ordered way too much food ... chili fries , egg rolls , a green burger , the secret bbq chicken sandwich , no harm chicken parm ... i barely had room to choke down a couple of tsoynami 's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich ! 

 even after we were stuffed , whitney took home enough leftovers for a week ! 

 the big question about green is "" why did n't i ever eat here , when i lived here ... why ? "" 

 i do n't know ... but i will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts , a tie dye t - shirt and growing a neck beard ... and i will be eating here again . 

 i like to "" fit in "" . 

 the menu is fairly extensive ... the portions are plenty big ... the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma 's ( always a big deal for me ) are both exotic and welcoming . 

 i did n't have to break out the bacon ( although i should have taken my flask ... no cocktails at green for donald ... oh well , agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary ) . 

 i really could eat this way on a regular basis ... it 's that good ... i probably wo n't , but it 's nice to know i could ! 

 i imagine that karma will have it 's own way of dealing with a self - justifying , trigger happy technotard ... for me , the occasional dinner at green nicely balances the karmic forces at work in my life ... and tastes good , too !"
5,"buckle is a really cool store .   they carry both men and women 's clothing and they have a huge selection of jeans .   from silver to lucky , they 're all there !  

 they also have really cute tops- from casual to dressier ones you could wear out to a club or bar .   it 's nice because this store has its own style ... kinda casual , a little funky , but definitely different than anything you 'd find at macy 's or nordstrom 's .  

 they also carry some shoes and accessories and the staff is really helpful .   you 'll also get a little punch card with your first purchase and after so many punches , you 'll get $ 10 or $ 15 off . 

 the clothes range in price , but generally , i 'd say everything in the store is pretty reasonable .   this location is in paradise valley mall- check it out !"
5,"like others , i found this studio through a living social coupon .   it is a great studio .   kim is so friendly and fun .   i would highly recommend the yoga classes .   they are both challenging and relaxing !   it is a small studio , but that gives it a really nice , intimate feel .   i definitely recommend it !"
5,"until bobby q 's entered my life i was nt a fan of bbq anything ! made me kinda sad to see so many people enjoying some messy ribs but anyways i i digress ... this place has changed my life for the better!. their st. louis ribs are fall off the bone amazing ! and their mac n cheese is a must have ! i have to admit this place has made me a bit of a ribs snob , if something does nt come close to bobby q 's i automatically right that place off . 

 a short review but you get the gist of it ..."
5,"what a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall .   would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino !   he is world traveler , so , it 's a   must try if it 's the best cup he 's ever had .   he was right !   do n't know if it 's in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top .   my hubby and i loved the caramel brulee taste ..   my son loved the hot "" warm "" cocoa .   yeah , we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd .   everyone was really friendly , though . the sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude !    we will be back ."
1,"i was here for a conference and saw their sign for a $ 10 lunch special which was n't available that day .   took over an hour to just get a lunch salad .   the waiter had major attitude . 
 avoid this place !"
4,"i have friends that i meet there once a month for a delicious greasy spoon breakfast and these guys never disappoint .   i am a breakfast maven so love their hash browns most of all .   if i 'm feeling a little decadent , i order a side of gravy with them .   it 's really nice to sit outside during the cooler months and have some fries and a shake too !"
4,"kinda of a rough and tumble crowd at times with the otb booth in the back corner of the bar . place is usually crowded after work with the blue collar drinking types and unless your a regular you will probably get ignored like i did on a previous visit . in this case , finally tried the food and it was surprisingly good . the waitress said that the buffalo wrap was good , so i went with grilled chicken tossed in mild wing sauce and that went into my wrap with the usual cheese , lettuce , some blue cheese and maybe a touch of bacon ? the wrap was huge and the chicken and blue cheese melded perfectly together . on the side dish selection wheel , i went with sweet potato fries - this was a decent version of that variety , but the raspberry sauce ? served as a dipping option was a fail . great service on a saturday afternoon and reasonable prices ( $ 8.99 ) for a filling lunch ."
4,"fabulous place .   the food is good and the selection of organic and specialty items is nice .   love the butcher shop and jerry the cellarmaster is abslutely fantastic .   seriously , if you want a bottle of wine - he is the best resource .   and if you go back frequently he tailors his suggestions to what you like .   my favorite thing about this store is that the staff tries so hard to treat you like a valuable customer .   they remember your name , ask after your kids and honestly act like they like you .   it feels like a small town grocery store and i love that .    breakfast is fantastic and the coffee is great .   everyone at the coffee counter is terrific .   this was a really great addition to the neighborhood ."
5,"this is my favorite hotel of all time , so far , at least of the kimpton ilk . i experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed , organic and local products , a lovely shower , and general happy relaxation . i love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day . the decor , half asian deco and half southwestern , works works works ."
5,"this past weekend i went to the vig uptown twice because it was that   good . this is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu . what i love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill . the cherry on top is the games they have to offer , bocce and bags ! 

 drinks 
 1 . moscow mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order , made with vodka / ginger beer and fresh lime juice . 
 2 . if you bring in your own "" pimp cup "" any size , they will fill it up with the mixed drink called pimms cup . 

 food 
 1 . vigazz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing . 
 2 . thai spicy vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i 've ever had so i highly recommend getting them ."
4,"a definite four stars , the focus on fresh food and a great breakfast has build a strong following at this destination location in scottsdale civic center . now that i think about it how can i not give this place a 5 stars theirs way to much creativity and freshnewssness in the fruit , veg and the nectar of the gods , coffee , all packed into one nice bright orange place .  

 old town has a few breakfast spots but this is one you have to find .   can i say i hope to see this as a scottsdale yelp "" hidden gem . "" 

 as for my last meal i had the prosciutto melt and it went past expectations , the fresh basil really added the extra taste .  

 service was ok , a typical cafe style , the restaurant does not seek to be over pertinacious , the look is clean and the cafe is a really nice touch with options to order and go .   

 so many little restaurants like this keeps me looking for the next one .   do n't forget for later in the night az 88 is just down a few steps .  

 happy breakfast , 
 kevin 
 ps there seems to be some kind of yelp trend , does a hand full of yelps make a difference in a restaurant , does that have a yelp definition when this happens ."
4,"came here and did drive - though to pick up a turkey sandwich and the "" man "" salad .    the salad was really good ! ! ! !   on a hot summer day , the salad is a perfect choice for lunch ! ! !"
3,"good , but the salad was not as good as remembered .   still think its a great spot in scootsdale !"
3,"lets just set the record straight here . zoe 's serves mediterranean just like qdoba serves mexican . 

 when i say just like the q , i mean the entire experience . walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel ; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants . zoe 's food was average and unimpressive . i did like the hummus though . their prices similar to independent and family operated mediterranean around the valley ; in some cases more . i would prefer to visit cypress grill , just up the street from this location , they 're my favorite medi in cenpho so far . 

 the staff here was friendly , they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes . do n't get me wrong , the food was in no way "" bad "" , per se . i just ca n't shake the feeling of "" i 've had better "" when thinking about my experience . 

 if you 're looking to fill your belly with food just because it 's time to eat , this might just be the place for you . if you 're interested in a great mediterranean meal , i implore you to please try something new . i likely wo n't be returning , we do live in the city of a million restaurants , go out and choose one ! ( but do n't take me at my word on that just made up fact ) . 

 happy yelping phoenix , now where 's my hummus ?"
3,"marriott 's beds are always the most comfortable out of all the hotels i 've stayed . i would not recommend marriott phoenix airport for an extended ( more than a week ) stay , though . all in all , the hotel is nice , and the staff is probably the friendliest i have dealt with in a long time . 

 there is no free wifi , and you 'd think that a chain like marriott would provide it for free . there are no refrigerators or microwave ovens in the rooms , either ."
5,"i 've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and i was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past saturday . 

 we finally woke up early enough on a saturday morning to hit up matt 's and then peruse the market before it got too hot .   we made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors .   he had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and i decided to try the key lime .   i was amazed at how natural it tasted .   there was nothing artificial about it , it just tasted exactly like it should .   these are very good , very simple cheesecakes .   i ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty .   there are a bunch of different sizes to choose from , all at very fair prices .   yummy !"

4,omg ! so good ! so fresh ! great burger joint . ordered the tri - tip steak sandwich with grilled onions . the steak was tender and perfectly pink . husband ordered the original with fries . the burger was juicy and a good size . the fries were perfectly seasoned and fresh . we split a drink . total bill was a bit over $ 14 . not a bad dinner price . place was empty when we got here at 9:00 on a saturday night but quickly filled up . great service and great food . we will make the habit a habit !

3,"if star of india ( soi ) is named after the historic ship that set sail from great britain to india then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare . 

 like many other indian restaurants in the valley , the smell of indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing . the place does not disappoint when it comes to service , it is warm , quick and attentive . the complimentary papadums ( indian flatbread ) with homemade chutneys ( condiments ) is usually the high point of a meal at soi. 

 experiences with the order could be as follows : 
 gobi parantha ( indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- the real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the soi parantha resembles a topping - less thin crust pizza . 
 lamb korma- the gravy is thick , nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre - cooked . 
 chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the god - food that is biryani but soi manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables . 
 disheartenment with the over - priced , sub - standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert . 

 finally , as observed in other reviews and the menu , if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and chef 's specialities . however in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost ."
4,"3 + meals for $ 10.75 ? great deal ! ask for your meal to go , so you do n't have to pay 50 cents for take out box :) 

 how do you get 3 + meals , you might ask ? packing & smushing ! first , add some meat , and use the wax paper to pack down the meat all along the sides and the bottom of the bowl . try to avoid empty spaces in between every piece of meat . then add your vegetables , and smush it all down with the wax paper with each layer of veggies you add . make sure to add enough meat and veggies so that your have a flat surface up to the brim of the bowl . add lots of green onions for extra flavor . 

 i recommend using the wheat noodles , because you can create a taller mountain of noodles and it 's healthier ! 

 advice for the sauce : add lots of it . since you 're now a packing queen / king , you ca n't use the recipes on yc 's wall , either double up or triple up . 

 ask the nice mongolian bbq chefs to add pineapples and cilantro , and then when they finish cooking up your food , add some sesame seeds for that lil extra somethin somethin !"
2,"they 're really slipping now .   with dinner , you get cole slaw - you can "" upgrade "" to soup or salad for 2.50 more .   really ?   i 've never heard of cole slaw being a pre - meal before .   i got the french onion soup , its actually better at mimi 's .   they put way too much cheese , the bread is pathetic and there 's hardly any onions in it . 

 the prime rib comes with horseradish - very weak and cut with butter .   never heard of that before either .   luckily i had some sour cream with my baked potato and i asked for some raw horseradish so i can concoct my own .   was n't the best , but way better than the butter !  

 the barbeque chicken was ok .   i 've had better at diners .   they did n't really season the bird , just threw some barbeque sauce on it .   at least it was n't terribly dry ... 

 i do n't think i 'm coming back to this one .   nooooo .."
4,"if you like beer , you 'll love papago .    they have a huge beer selection and the prices are very good .   when ever i 'm in scottsdale , i make it a point to visit them ."
2,"as a pretty devoted fry 's shopper , i have to say this is one of my least favorite locations . unfortunately , it 's the closest one to me , so i end up there often . it 's almost always crowded , the layout is less than intuitive , and i 've gotten questionable produce on more than one occasion . the employees are friendly enough , but it 's just no comparison to other locations . 

 by the looks of it outside , it seems like it would be pretty large , but once you get inside it 's cramped and the selections seem limited . 

 i suppose this is mostly things they ca n't change , but it 's enough to make me drive a few miles out of my way to avoid it if i have the time ."
4,"here last night with friends . we had to wait a little longer to be seated than i would have liked but we were a party of five so i understand . once we were seated service was quick and pleasant . we shared a couple of the flatbreads to start , so by the time we ordered entrees i was already pretty full and went with a salad , the strawberry balsamic , which was delicious and just made me feel all ready for summer . we were there quite a while talking and enjoying our meal , and the staff never made us feel hurried although it was a pretty busy night . we tipped well enough that i do n't feel bad about taking up space for that long , that 's something i always make sure to do in that situation ."
5,"i love you , marquee theatre . 

 just last night i saw dashboard confessional here and it was packed . 
 i have seen many shows here and i have not a single complaint about the marquee . the bartenders are really friendly , the bouncers do a great job , and the bands they have play here are always phenomenal . not to mention , the sound guys do an awesome job . 

 i love how big it is in the marquee , because it allows for tons of people to see a great show . one thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue , the marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there . 

 the only thing i hate ( and this has nothing to do with the marquee itself ) is that i am always standing next to belligerently drunk , annoying girls who ca n't seem to keep their mouths shut during a set .... please do n't speak ... i am listening to chris carrabba 's angelic voice , thanks . 

 all in all , i think that the marquee theatre is my favorite venue of all time ."

4,"i am not a beer drinker , so this is not rating the beer , but the food and atmosphere . 

 1 ) atmosphere : sweet - great patio and nice bar scene inside 

 2 ) food - pretty good for bar food 

 3 ) hit it up if you are in tempe , its just one of those places you need to go"
5,"no matter where you go in the world if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out "" in and out man i love that place "" i think that says it all ."
2,"this place could be great , and i 've always wanted to like it more than i actually do .   occasionally , i have stopped into mill 's end for breakfast , specifically because they have crepes on their menu ; in fact , their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe .   for reasons explained below , lately i 've found myself just walking past mill 's end , no longer considering giving it my business .   the general issues that i have with this place involve just a couple of basic things ; if the owners made the effort to correct these , i believe mill 's end could be a great cafe . 

 i have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors .   it is with all three of these that mill 's end falls short : 

 1)ambience .   this means that the environment must be suitable both for studying / reading , as well as relaxation .   so , the music playing needs to be something that is non - intrusive and that the customers can generally ignore ; sometimes mill 's end has this covered , but other times not at all .   onto the seating .   it seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995 , in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the tv show "" friends ; "" unfortunately , they did n't come close , but there is usually plenty of seating open .   by the way , what is up with pseudo - sexual ice photography on the walls ? 

 2)price .   this is actually my number one problem with mill 's end .   the coffee is reasonably priced , but the food is too expensive .   anytime i tell someone that i ate there , it 's always the same response , "" yeah , their food is good , but it 's really pricey . ""   considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop , i imagine that their business has gone up , but those prices sure have n't dropped . 

 3.customer service .   the staff has always been just lukewarm .   look , i do n't expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time , i only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality ; this has just always been kind of lacking at mill 's end . 

 honestly , i think this place has a lot of potential , but it seems to be awash in complacency ."
1,"i waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it , served in a aluminum take - out box . the tables are folding tables , like the kind you play beer pong on . and they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too , which has nothing to do with asian / mexican cuisine , it creeped me out ."

5,"i love cupcakes . its true . i really do . i have waited in an hour long line outside of magnolia bakery in nyc to experience the bakery that started the cupcake craze . that said , if there is a good cupcake to be had , i 'm on my way to experience it . i must note- that i am not a fan of sprinkles ; as i think they are overly dry and waayy too hyped . 

 we just ordered two dozen different flavors from mind over batter to celebrate our august birthdays ( its a tradition we do once a month from baker 's around town ) . because of my love for all thinks coffee- i got the carmel mocchiato . let me just say- i wished i took a picture . but i could n't help but to dive in . mocha buttercream frosting - piled high , crushed coffee toffee and carmel drizzle . 

 i also heard rave reviews from the office about the birthday cake and the chocolate red velvet . the one i most want to try is the lemon drop ( because i love lemon ) . 

 i 'll be back in very soon to check out more flavors and cake pops ."
3,"if you do n't want to read the whole review , i 'll sum it up in one sentence -- via delosantos only uses yellow cheese . 

 i went here about 4 years ago for a celebratory occasion , and was afraid to eat the food based on the smell of old grease and the look of the entrees on tables around . we ate on the patio , which is directly on central avenue , and after the horrid smell of grease & exhaust pipes , i could n't wait to flee the scene . 

 last year , i was unknowingly led back to this same place .   years had passed , and i had completely forgotten about my vow to never return . this time , i was pleased . 

 it probably helps that upon entering my expectations were very low . i immediately was attracted to the kitschy mexican artwork , their vast tequila collection on display , and of course , the christmas lights . 

 the salsa seemed fresh and was just the right amount of spice . they keep the chips & salsa flowing so be careful not to fill up .   the margaritas are really sweet , but they 're cheap and will get the job done . 

 this is the kind of place where you stick to basics . do n't get fancy or try and order something healthy .   get a chimichanga , burrito ,   shrimp enchiladas , or a chile relleno , and if it 's appropriate , get that sucker enchilada style . be sure to have your tums handy when done if you think you can eat a whole plate by yourself . 

 the portions are huge and totally splitable .   oh , last word of advice , do n't get the guacamole . it 's super gringo , and has a ton of sour cream in it . 

 i 'm giving this place 3 stars b / c it 's a good value if you 're sharing , they ambiance is very comfortable & amusing , and the service is very accommodating ."
5,"here 's the deal . i said i was done with ot , but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot . 

 my friend was right . 

 everything i had a problem with before was remedied . i went in unannounced , did n't tell anyone about a previous bad experience , and i was given some of the best service i 've received in town . when we went in , we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit . 

 no texting employees , no indifferent waitstaff . the chef was in the food window expediting food , making sure it went out promptly and correctly . not only was our server attentive , but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks , debris on the table , etc . 

 the decor has been refreshed , and although i did n't dislike the decor originally , it is definitely an upgrade as well . now its much cleaner , but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before . 

 props to the new management . well done . i 'll be back . 

 ps - forgot to order side syrup . curious to see if they still charge $ 2 ."
3,"a bit disappointed so writing after only one exploratory visit and a revisit for the one dish that deserved an encore . 

 the ossobucco was the major disappointment , a beautiful presentation that lacked flavor and was past overcooked . one of my favorite dishes when prepared correctly , but they just missed - badly ! 

 on the plus side the gnocchi were little pillows of wonderfulness ! reminded me on our neighborhood   "" little italian lady "" who made it for me as a child over 60 years ago and was , until now , the very best i have ever had . this version was very close and was served with a wonderful four cheese white sauce ( calorie free for certain ! ) . the caesar salad was a decent rendition but nothing i have eaten here approached the gnocchi , unfortunately . 

 worth the trip for the gnocchi alone !"
3,"came out last night with a few friends . the bar was cool , but i 'm really not a fan of the crowd in old town . the drink prices were not bad , but it was a blast dancing outside . overall a pretty cool spot ."
5,"ben & jerry 's is still the best chain ice cream shop ! the employees are always helpful and polite , and their flavors are just outrageous ! the smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by , and you ca n't resist . whether you go for new flavors or classics like cherry garcia and phish food , you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency ."
5,"even though i 've rarely had anything else on their menu except for hummus , i highly recommend this little greek hot spot . they have tons of regulars because the food keeps them coming back . the hummus is to die for ( it only comes with one pita however , so i always order 2 - 3 extra ) . i have also tried their veggie gyro which is great . i have brought many meat - loving friends here and i 've never heard anything but great things about their experience with their food . 

 the staff is completely greek . they are friendly in their own unique kind of way . because i usually saunter in with a drink from starbucks ( same parking lot ) , the female owner assumes i work there and she always asks me how business is going at sb . i corrected her the first few times , but she continued to ask , so now i just keep it going and tell her it 's going great but that i hate my job ( because i 'm assuming i would , if i worked there ) . i love her personality ... very intense . never smiles , even when a smile would be just right . but she is still very kind . always look forward to seeing her and eating her food ."
1,i ( like others ) am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review . tasteless and awful
4,"i hate to find out that there was another location closer to where i was .   it does n't matter because it was worth the trip .   i ordered pick up because i was by myself and wanted to a bit of exploring .   the place has a nice casual ambiance .   they also have an outdoor seating area .   i ordered the pad thai that comes with chicken and shrimp as a standard .   since it was lunch time , it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad .   i chose the soup , but was too stuffed to have it because i jumped right into the pad thai .   i ordered it medium spicy , and it was pretty spicy .   i ca n't imagine what hot would have tasted like .   actually , i 'm more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor .   the noodles were slightly overcooked , but still flavorful .   i also had the thai iced tea here , and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor .   the prices are expensive compared to chicago , but i hear it 's typical for phoenix / scottsdale area .   my lunch speciai and drink costed me a little over $ 15 .   i guess if you are craving it that bad like i was , you 'll pay the price ..."
5,"i love this place ! i love that it 's to - go only ( no 3 hour waits , like pizzaria bianco ) , and the mozzarella is mouth watering . 
 please try the mozzarella , tomato , basil sandwich . you wo n't regret it !"
4,"every time i drove by this store with my brother i mused upon the social issues faced in a food city .  

 do you suppose they have problems with segregation / integration ?   you know , the   tomatoes claim that the bagels could have moved into the produce department if they had chosen to ; they just chose to occupy shelf space in the bakery department because they liked being with their own kind ?   does n't a bathroom cleaning product have the same rights to locate itself in a freezer case as a gelato does if that 's what its little heart desires ?   do the canned yams believe that there is nothing wrong with the candy in the bulk food section , they just would n't want their daughter to marry one ?   i almost wanted to stick a carrot in the dairy section just to make the point .   no more separate but equal around here .   nope , we 're a modern day non - bigotted "" everybody deserves a fair shot around here "" kind of grocery store . 

 well , i finally had the occasion to stop in here over the the weekend i was visiting phoenix and was surprised to discover it catered to a mainly hispanic customer base .   being from bakersfield , california , this made me feel at home at once !   there was mariachi music playing over the pa system , and there were spanish language entertainment magazines by the checkout .  

 i stopped in because a friend texted me to pick up a bottle of pinot grigio for her .   now , i know that those of you who shop here regularly are probably still rolling on the floor laughing , but remember - i 'm from out of state and did n't know any better .   when i discovered their tiny wine section , and that it was mostly carlo rossi & gallo wine , i was momentarily downcast .   but there , on the very top shelf , were a few varietals by a decent australian wine cellar and - lo and behold - one lonely pinot grigio .   ta - da !   cue cherubs descending earthward blowing trumpets in celebration .   and to make it even more exciting it was on sale !   yes , normally priced at $ 7.99 a bottle , they were on sale for $ 5.99 each .   i decided to bring her two bottles just to celebrate . 

 the checker was very friendly and spoke english with only a minimal accent so bonus there , too .   the final kicker was when i gave my friend the receipt she discovered they 'd only charged me $ 4.99 per bottle . woohoo ! 

 the store was very clean and i did notice they had an excellent selection of hispanic themed items so if you 're looking for that sort of thing , this place might be for you !"
5,"expect no com tam - foolery here .... this joint is serious about their broken rice business ! 

 endless options of different broken rice ( aka com tam= deliciousness )   dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy , all within your $ 6 - 10 wallet budget ! service is prompt and efficient , menu is ez to follow , focus your energy on the broken rice dishes ; that s what they re known for . 

 i highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side . the portion is huge and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique , bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate . my personal favorite is the steamed egg ; there 's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice . go easy on the fish sauce ( ngoc mam ) they give you on the side ( try adding sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life ) , the dish is by far no means lacking in flavor / sodium . all at a pansy $ 5.99 , i could really eat this all day ... everyday !"
4,"i dabble in vegetarianism / veganism here and there , and this place is awesome .   this is a great restaurant for people who are not vegans / vegetarians and want to try it , or think vegan food is "" weird "" ( in the words of a friend ) .   everything here is flavored so well , and the dishes are delicious . i love all the apps , and have tried several of the entrees and thought they were all pretty good . they also have a fabulous selection of creative drinks . i hope this place sticks around for a long time , since it never seems to be busy when i go . the staff is very open and friendly and knowledgeable about the food , so never hesitate to ask if you 're unsure about something !"
3,"i 'm not a woman and i do n't read people magazines at the gym so i 'm not sure i 'm really the qualified demo for this place . nonetheless , in spite of all the hype and hyperbole , it 's a good cupcake .   when the olive oil vanilla cupcakes from the olive oil mill are too far away , this becomes the cupcake backup .   especially the vanilla . 

 i 'd give this place a better review but i do n't because i consider the cupcake to be the "" rodney dangerfield "" of desserts .   too many far better post meal options come to mind before i 'd waste my valuable calorie allotment on a cupcake ."
4,"if you love pickles you 'll love old town whiskey . we 've been here twice so far , and both times , we 've been very pleased .   so far , i 've only tried their pickled beets and pickled cherry tomatoes , but both were absolutely fantastic .   the cherry tomatoes were so sweet and sour , they paired perfectly with the ricotta , olive tapenade and crustini they were served with .   this place is a gold mine if you 're a whiskey drinker , my hottie loves some good whiskey and was really impressed with their selection ... not to mention he said the burger was probably the best he 'd had .   i ca n't wait to get a taste of their veggie burger , but i have n't gone hungry enough yet ... next time for sure !   we went for happy hour this past friday , and they had a lovely agave fizz cocktail on special , very refreshing .   their happy hour is progressive , meaning that everything is $ 5 from 5 - 6 , $ 6 from 6 - 7 , and it runs every day ."
1,"first off , the restaurant is dim and dark .. i thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain . the waiter there did not have a smile and did n't seem freindly , it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at . the service sucked ass . i mean come on , there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time , he did n't check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill .. like seriously ... ? are you that lazy . bun bo hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side . pho had a rancid smell . noodles in my sister 's bun thit nuong were hard and watery ( seemed like they were super old ) overall , i would n't recommend to anybody ."
4,i 've been hearing good things about this coffee house in cave creek so when a friend suggested we meet there i was all for it . easy to see furniture store big bronco and janey 's is behind it . very good coffee and i 'll come back to try the food .   comfortable place to just hang out .
4,"the food here is amazing ! so full of flavor , not fat . healthy , and delicious !   prices in the 10 range for a salad , and 20 range for an entree ' .   the resturant is very loud , because they are always busy . the chairs are too small for my hips , making it uncomfortable to stay very long .   oh well . i suppose they expect , if you eat here , you must be a size 6 ."
5,"attended the pink charity event at the shade bar .   great time and the scene was fantastic . 

 need to highlight the job that jason and halley do with vip tables .   i 've worked with both of them twice now and the experience is always top notch .   always ensure that the experience is better than expected ."
3,"if i could eat a southwestern caesar salad once a day , every day , i think i would . this is one of my favorite salads ... ever . paradise in general is a little overpriced but one in a while , i 'll bite the bullet and splurge . my only complaint is their lack of vegetarian options . for a restaurant that specializes in soups , salads and sandwiches , it would make sense to have more than one or two options in each category suitable for veggies ."
5,"love chino bandido .   the snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven .   well , all of the food might actually be heaven , but usually by the time i get to the snickerdoodle i could die happy on the spot ."
5,"the facility is a bit dated , but the service is great .   dr. rios is patient and thorough , and his staff are friendly and efficient .   dr. rios gave me several different alternative contacts to try in order to make sure that i was getting the right fit for me - it made a big difference .   who knew that they make bi - focal contacts now ?   they 're great ."
2,"ya know - i could see this place being very inconsistent and i was there on a ho hum day .    the wine recommended was their chianti which tasted pretty bad , they have a weird assortment of imported beers , and like a couple other reviews the pizza had little flavor .   we order a pesto chicken pizza and we had to bite around on each piece to find the pesto , no flavor , a bit dry and the pizza was really late and warm - late and warm which means =   sat there for a while .   our waitress was nice , cute , fun but hey that only gets you 2 stars .    the salad was better than the pizza and the wings were pretty good . - that s all folks . ! !"
4,"nice restaurant and hookah lounge .   the service is ... as it is in every middle eastern restaurant i 've been to - t 's not bad , but not good ; if you ask for something they take care of you , but otherwise they do the bare minimum .   nice people , though .   i had the best falafel ever the other day when i ate some late lunch at the restaurant .   the market has a nice selection of hookahs , shisha , and accessories .   i 'll be back , for sure ."
4,"brio is delish , plain and simple . i have yet to get something that is nt tasty . i live about 15 - 20 miles from one so i do nt get out there too often but i do wish there was one closer to my area ."
3,"huge portions of delicious pulled pork , perfect coleslaw , ice cold drinks , plenty of tvs , and friendly staff make this a fun place you should try !   ohhhh yeah , be sure to use the yelp check in deal for a free desert !   we went with the death by chocolate !   it is built for two and ohhh so delicious ! 

 however , i am only going with three stars due to limited bbq meat selection compared to the others in town , limited cramped parking , and dirty paper menus ."
3,"i 've probably passed by this place a thousand times without ever stopping in before today . as others have pointed out , it 's small and intimate , but i liked the charming atmosphere . 

 i ordered the seasoned grilled chicken on cibatta and a desert blossom iced tea ( lavender , hibiscus , apricot and rosehips ) . the sandwich was well balanced and moist . it was served with iceberg , roma tomatoes and a side of their house fries , "" kilo fries . "" the fries were seasoned with a cheese blend , which seemed a little dry to me . however , a quick swirl in olive oil improved them quite a bit . the tea was delicate and refreshing - a nice complement to my lunch selection . 

 the service is what stood out for me here . my server was friendly and attentive throughout the meal , even though i was dining solo . i certainly felt that my business was valued here . she even offered me a to - go cup for my tea , which was a nice touch . 

 i will definitely be back to explore more of their menu . prices are reasonable too , which does n't hurt !"
4,"loved the location at atmosphere of this place !   had a very nice business dinner here last night .   we were able to sit outside thanks to the gorgeous weather , and i 'd recommend this to anyone .   the houses inside have their charm , but al fresco dining is great !  

 we had a few drinks at the bar before we started dinner - they have a fairly nice wine by the glass list , as well as a nice stocked bar .   something for everyone ! 

 the menu contained lots of delicious choices , and it was hard to choose .   ended up going with hapuku , which was a new - to - me fish from new zealand , similar to grouper .   it was delicious - tender , flaky , and the earthy vegetables with it were a nice complement . 

 we had very polite service , though not well - timed .   i like when plates are cleared all at once for people , instead of taking plates at the table away when others are eating .   or , bringing the bill before we 've finished dessert .   both of these happened here ."
2,"i always pay in cash at this panda 's . if it was n't across the street from work , i would n't go here at all . 

 two separate times i have been double billed on my debit card for my lunch . i 'm not saying it was intentional , but either way it is annoying to have to dispute a charge with your bank . 

 fair warning ."
4,"great customer service !   bought a compromised food item and they assured me that this issue would be corrected immediately . 

 plus they insisted on comping me the best medjool dates i have ever ever tasted .   i had been happy to pay $ 7 per pound for them because they are utterly superior when purchasing them before ."
4,"our second experience here was much better . we knew to stay away from the traditional fattier foods and stuck with healthier options . we had : 
  - mussels appetizer 
  - stuffed mushrooms appetizer 
  - chicken flatbread 
  - salmon 
  - scallops 

 everything had quite a bit of flavor and was prepared well . we would return again !"
4,"i think fate is delicious and great ! i love the remodeled house the restaurant is in .... super cute ! fate 's crab puffs are simply amazing , filled with cream cheese and crab goodness !   the hong kong flat rice noodles are scrumptious ! the sauce on the flat rice noodles is so flavorful , i could   eat them all day ! i do n't get all of the bad reviews on fate . i think those people are simply crazy !"
3,"i only go here when my little cousin is in town and he adores this place . my cousin is 4 years old and obsessed with trains so he loves the small train display , the stationary trains you can walk through and the little train that goes around the park that you can ride on . a definite place to go with little kids especially if they like the trains ."
2,"i do n't know why i have been here more than once , but the parking is horrible , and the food is only so - so .   lots of color and flare but not much going for it .   the baja sauce is great but i seem to get sick later that evening when i eat it .   i need to learn from experience"
1,"i will precede this lackluster review by stating the following : 

 1)i have only been to this place once . 
 2)i did n't get a chance to actually try the cuisine . 
 3)i am a sympathetic person to servers , as i have been one . 

 that being said , i give this place one star for reasons of poor service . 

 about six months ago , at around 4 pm on a sunday afternoon , we decided to eat at this place . the atmosphere was warm and cozy ; typical college bar with college - aged waitresses . 

 we made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers . the beers came , the food never did , and we watched other patrons come in , eat , and leave .   all the while , our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks ( we got them ourselves from the bar ) . 

 since my bf and i both worked in food service , we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under - staffed .   but after an hour of waiting , we finally crossed the room to speak with our server . she said , "" i ca n't imagine it will be much longer . "" i think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket , which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook . 

 where was the manager that day ? or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all ? 

 we left money on the table for our beers and walked out . i guess there is a first time for everything ."
5,"i love this place .   the first time i went , i had my mom and my sister with me .   we all got pedicures and by far the best foot massages i 've had at any of these nail places .   the thing that really impresses me the most is that after only one visit ... the next time i came in- they greeted me by my name . how often does that happen ?   hello , customer service- welcome back .   it 's husband and wife owned and operated and they are as nice as can be . love it here .   great atmosphere , friendly , good service , affordable .   you wo n't be disappointed ."
4,we ate there last night and were very pleased our meals and service .   the ribs were especially good .   we would go back again .
5,"sprouts is my favorite market to shop at ! they are a great company who have a very friendly staff in their stores as well as their corporate office . they are also very involved with the community and with local farmers and businesses ! 

 the prices for all the fresh and natural groceries they carry are the most reasonable out of all the grocery stores i have been too ! the vitamin department has everything you could ever look for to help your well being and they are always extravaganzas in the stores so you are always getting the most out of your money , and in times like these i know people are very appreciative of that since groceries are becoming more and more expensive everyday , or so it seems ! 

 i most definitely recommend anyone to shop at sprouts !"
4,"we had a wonderful four nights at gainey ranch . the rooms were beautifully appointed ( although not enough drawer space ) , immaculate , and high quality bath products , bed linens and furniture . we had a 3rd floor garden view , which was very zen with a natural pond and fountain , and access to their regency club ( a must have ) . the spa was very nice and they carry high quality products . they also have so many options to hang by a pool , including a private spa mineral pool ( sans children ) . we understand there is a great kids pool also . the food was delicious at their restaurant also . 

 we did not experience any construction issues ( as they may be finished ) , but we certainly benefited from all their efforts . it is beautifully appointed and plenty of spaces that feel private . it is not a convention - like hotel , but i have heard ( from a corporate event planner ) they do a wonderful job for large parties . 

 everyone from the valet , to registration , housekeeping and wait staff were more than accommodating and very friendly . kudos to their general manager , who when we brought up the issue of not having enough drawer space , immediately remedied the situation . ( i wo n't say how , as i do n't want to turn it into a precedent . i 'll just say , he went above and beyond . ) 

 i would return to scottsdale just to visit the hyatt . happens to be a bonus we have wonderful family that we can visit too !"
5,nic - nacs galore !
1,"omg ... hands down the worst chinese food i 've ever had anywhere .   stopped by for lunch with my wife .   i ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp .   barely edible .   makes panda express look like gourmet chinese food .   prior to flo 's , the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in nebraska ... but that 's nebraska .   i 'm chinese and live in san francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food ."
3,"i so wish you could do 3 1/2 stars .   i would give it . 

 not bad chinese .   nyc style .   if you have lived in or around nyc you would completely understand . 

 i love the fried dumplings .   so good ! !   highly recommend them .   pork lomein is good to .    take out for sure .   not really a place to sit and eat .   you can do it but it is more geared for take out ."
4,"love shopping here ! it 's pricey , so i do n't do my regular grocery shopping at this place , but it has a lot of unique , gourmet options . it 's a fun splurge !"
4,"i tried to give full marks to lolo 's having heard all the hype . realize that i am coming from louisiana and also new york city where one can obtain the namesake specialty rather easily and in variations . 
 instead of telling you all the cliche things that you will need to know about lolo 's , i am going to tell you why ultimately i did not "" drink the kool - aid on a   5 star rating .  

 better pricing is the missing star .   i found the place to be on the expensive side for what you get .   it is perhaps a part of my relationship towards this home cooking that makes me feel this way .   but please note :   service was great ... but do n't plan on being in and out for a quick lunch unless to do a to go order ... also , these waffles are wonderfully flavored .   i detected a nice hint of vanilla and a touch of cinnamon .   the chicken is nicely seasoned ... nothing greasy about this batch .   i will also say that if you are not used to kool - aid , or if you are like me and used to be able to water that thing down until the original colour had faded by simply adding batches and batches of sugar to it .... you will be in for a diabetic shock ! here 's what to do : ask for a side glass of water and then inject some of the kool - aid into the water .   my favorite is grape drink ! ! !  

 i am hoping to get back to lolo 's to try their gizzards .   i had the basics on this trip and it is really worth the return trip .   bring your friends and go and eat late there on friday night !"
5,"stopped in here for lunch today joined by mike c. & robyn n.   this was my third visit ever to a cb & the first time to this one .   i went with a reuben sandwich plate , which included a cup of cole slaw & a cup of beefy cabbage soup .   the service was good at this location , the atmosphere fun , the food delicious & the prices reasonable .   5 stars !      :-)) 

 reuben sandwich plate $ 8.19"
5,"maybe it was the authentic gospel music in the background , but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred , and until this morning unknown , pairing of chicken and waffles -- a combination rivaled by only bread and wine in it 's ability to induce a religious experience ."
4,"my home airport , so with work travel , i 'm passing through here very often . i prefer terminal 4 because of the variety of eating / drinking options for pre - flight enjoyment , and 2 and 3 are just ok and do n't offer so much in amenities ... but they 're less crowded and that is a nice plus .   also , free wifi ! 

 i rarely get lost in here and to be honest , security here has never been an issue ... lines have been long going to gates in term 4 but they move fairly quickly . 

 i do n't do body - scans ( my personal choice ) , so if you choose to do the same , when you put your crap in the conveyor belt and you note they are only doing body scanners , alert the tsa person and let them know you 'll need a pat - down ( or a groping .. feel - up .... whatever you wanna call it ; ) ) .   electing to do this takes me longer to get through security , but i prefer it and plan ahead . 

 also , if you have a digital boarding pass on your iphone or android and go through a * different * gate ( they are mostly all connected via runways , etc ) due to the line at the gate you 're supposed to go through , note that they may not be able to scan your digital boarding pass ... this happened to us once when we went to another gate with a significantly shorter line .. luckily they had the kiosk just there so i ran out of line and printed them out while hubby held my spot .   fyi ! !"
4,"if you 're looking for a good meal with solid service you 'll find it here .   the menu has something for everyone , too .   if you like to go out for lunch or brunch , this is a great place to go .   friendly , fast staff helps make the experience that much better ."
3,"the last three times i have been here , the hostesses have been so incredibly rude i have to update and ding them a star . the last time was the last straw and we just left turned around and left . 
 yes , you work at a popular property . that does not entitle you to be rude and nasty . it 's weird as it seems to limited just to the front of the house . the waitstaff is usually great , food is great , and cocktails are top notch . 
 whoever is running this place , its time for a sit down with your girls in the front ."
2,i really was n't impressed with the service or the food .
1,"eeew . it started with a cranky waiter who told me that if i wanted to know the specials , then i should have read them on the board . the food was downhill from there . the entire place smelled like fried onions ."
3,"i like this quaint little restaurant although the space is a bit crowded - especially during peak times . too bad all they really serve is pizza ( there are other things on the menu - but not much else ) . i thought the pizza was ok - but certainly nothing to rave about . desert was awesome -- they have a selection of crepes to choose from which are all to die for ! 

 bottom line : experience is nice and unexpected for phoenix . food is not disappointing as long as you are n't expecting a lot . desert is special ."
2,"things i liked : the homemade chips ( mmm ) , the red salsa , the tender chicken pieces in my enchiladas and the service . 

 things that just did n't work for me- the green sauce was so blah i could n't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor . the beans and rice were disappointing as well . perhaps it is my lack of familiarity with new mexican cuisine , but i was not impressed ."
5,"i have been to this place many times and the food and service is always great . i am so excited to have found a place where i can get freshly made , good food out here in queen creek . my favorite is their home made mozzarella cheese . its great on anything . i frequently order the tomato , basil and mozzarella pizza and i recently discovered their vegetarian plate which was delicious . the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable . do n't forget to save room for the amazing ice cream they have ."
4,"this review is a little late coming , but just got myself some fabulous chocolates and remembered how addicted i am to the passion fruit ones . it 's a good things they 're so pricey or i would probably eat an entire box . 
 julia baker also did our wedding cake in 2010 . the cake was a beautiful three tier red velvet . it tasted amazing , we still get compliments on it . julia and all her employees were a joy to work with , the tasting appointment was one of our favorite parts of wedding planning . would definitely recommend . 

 lost a star because they are a tad bit overpriced . also the design on our cake was the wrong color , our wedding color was an olive green and the cake design was a bright almost neon green and we had asked for an olive or dark emerald color . if there was n't a million other things going on i might have stressed about it but as it were the cake tasted great enough to make up for it . 

 they did n't last too long at the montelucia , which is usually when i 'd stop in for a treat . i 'm not sure where they moved but i know that you can buy the truffles and chocolates ( seriously try the passion fruit ) at aj 's fine foods in the area ."
4,"handsdown , anthro is my favorite store ...   every major city i 'm in , i map out anthro to see what is in their sales racks .... boston , chicago , sf , austin .. etc etc .   this is the closet of a roommate i 've never had , she is so decadent cool w / out flaunting it . 

 always adored the sales rack , but most recently the finds have been for home area ... knobs , pulls , face plates for light switches as we refurbish a new home ..."
1,this place was messy and loud .   the food really was n't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together .   overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food .   i will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me
4,"i really am a fan of this place . it has good food and good beer , and also is associated with some good memories here . this place is a great place to come to and watch a game or two . or in our case , a great place to come to after watching out team win or lose the game . the parking here can be difficult since there is no lot or anything designated for costumer parking . the beer is really good here . i like the lighter beers , such as their regular peach beer , but their other beers and seasonal are awesome too . the food is delish ; i always get a hankering for their beer battered fries . eat it with their jalapeño ranch sauce and it 's perfect . that and some loaded chicken nachos are easily split between friends ; their portion sizes are fairly huge . it 's really an awesome spot to get together with friend , have a pint , enjoy a game and some good food ."
4,"the first thing to know about this los reyes location is that it is quite different from the one on 7th st !   it 's a different menu here , for starters !   i had my heart set on my usual , a "" torta norteña , & a 99 cent ceviché .   they do n't have those things here , so i settled for the nearest looking sandwich , a "" mexican torta "" .   ( my server did say the ownership is the same as the sunnyslope location . )   anyhow , here 's how it was for me here today : 

 *   this is a good sized place , & i managed to find both a parking space & a comfortable table inside to land at , even though they were roaring busy ! 

 *   my nice server almost immediately brought me a big basket of tortilla chips & two kinds of salsa , medium & hot !   both were good .   ( they do n't even serve tortilla chips at sunnyslope . ) 

 *   i ordered , & it took a little while for my sandwich to arrive , but as i said , they were super busy !   no problemo .   meanwhile , i ate about half of my chips , & señorita brought me another big basket of them , & more salsa ! 

 *   my torta arrived , & it was big & delicious !   it comes with a side salad , which included some pimento & cucumber slices , lime halves , lettuce , & a fried quarter onion .   all this was good too ( &   did remind me of the other location ) . 

 *   gripes ?   three tvs blabbing out a show in spanish , fairly loud , & this place was noisy to begin with . 

 so ?   ... i did n't care as much for the menu here as sunnyslope , & the tvs were a bit of a nuisance , but with that said , i still think this is an very good place to eat , & the value was amazing at only $ 6.50 for everything !      :-))"
5,"this store used to be closer to 19th ave & bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years . everything is made fresh daily ceviche , guacamole , salsa 's , they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm . you can pick up the old school soda 's here , and good mexican favs like pinguinos , gansitos , duvalin , pelon pelo rico , de las rosa , and even bimbo bread just to name a few thing 's they carry here . they have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbq'd you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many "" libras "" ( pounds ) and you want them to make it "" preparada "" they will put in their special marinade w oranges , onions , and spices in the bag . if your a meat eater you ca nt go wrong here . i ca nt get enough of this place ! !"
2,"i do n't get it . not the concept of a good vegetarian restaurant but the need to create mock this and mock that . the word mock appears on the menu no less than 30 times , and that made me want to flee pell mell at mach 1 out of there , sonic boom be damned . i understand it from a   marketing strategy to appeal to and or convert the carnivores and omnivores i suppose . do meat eaters feel better about eating something vegetarian as long as it is shaped like a chicken wing ? has anyone gone to a steak joint and had mock carrots made from pork medallions ?   i am also aware that we eat with our eyes , have preconceived notions of certain types of cuisine etc . however , i firmly believe that if an establishment uses veggies , legumes , tofu and such and gets creative instead of trying to reinvent the meat wheel , the end result would be much better . for example the mexicali burger , no mock meat reference here . how about listing something as "" whatever the hell it is "" served parmesan style ? 
 
 i stopped here for lunch yesterday as i was in the area . cool space , it was open colorful and inviting . a couple of organs line a small space up front . nice mild funk flavor to the decor . ordering is done counter style and they bring it out to you . you pretty much go behind the counter to get ice for your beverage which i thought was a bit of a weird queue . 

 i ordered the spicy thai peanut , a dish that offered mock choices , but i went with the crispy tofu . the brown rice that was the bedding here was ok , lukewarm at best . the dish lacked any real flavor and there was no spice whatsoever . the tofu tasted as if it was freezer burned , which really dumbfounded me . i think it may have been crisped long before it was served to me and microwaved , the texture was just off . copious amounts of cock sauce , err ... sriracha saved it from blandsville . 

 i am not saying i would never return , as i tend to give places more than one chance . i love well prepared vegetarian dishes , just do n't mock me ."
4,where else can you get a chile relleno wrapped in a tortilla to make a burrito ? super crunchy friend goodness with oozy melty cheese in every bite .. oh the overkill and love every second of it ! ! jen red pork in a quesadilla with a side of black beans and jerk fried rice .. this is some serious hybrid comfort food .. may sound strange but works very well ! you 'll leave super stuffed and change in your wallet from a $ 10 !
5,"restaurant 28 is a solid hole - in - the - wall that 's pretty easy to miss , but it 's definitely worth a stop .   on my visits i 've gotten brisket and other barbecue , and my friends swear by the chicken and say it 's some of their favorite chicken in the valley .   the hush puppies are great- the greens are good too . 

 another review said it well when they said this place does n't underseason food .   every time i 've gone it has n't been bland- it 's got some great flavor and it 's tasty stuff . 

 it 's in a pretty dull area where there is n't much else to do , or i 'd be out there more often .   it 's a tiny place too but i 've never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy . 

 definitely recommended , and i hope they 're able to grow and thrive ."
4,"great food , fresh crispy veggies , excellent service . i love the luau pork , but it 's kind of salty , even for me considering i love salty food !   mango iced tea is very refreshing and key lime pie is gooood . i have tried the tofu but it has been hit or miss the way they cook it . i like it crispier ( or as crispy as you can get tofu : )"
4,i love target .   this is a great one . parking is decent and it 's right at desert ridge next to everything else so it 's a convienent location .
5,"get . the . cider . just do it . i 'm a huge cider fan and this is the best i 've ever had . not syrupy sweet , and nice and cloudy so you know that it 's been brewed from actual fruit and not some secret sugar concoction . their master brewer also brews all of their sodas . grab a taster for the sodas and see which one you like best . my favorite is the vanilla . the staff is ridiculously friendly and willing to answer any questions you have and will have a nice chat with you if they 're not busy . 

 the sandwiches are quite tasty as well . i 've had the mario 's monster mill - wich , and my boyfriend has had the tuna and the french dip . all have been really good , but if you do n't like a lot of feta on your sandwich i would suggest letting them know because they really pile it on ( mario 's ) ! i love it so it was no problem for me ."
5,"everything here is awesome ! i love the kung pao shrimp and the hong kong soup which has wontons and and egg noodles they make in house . the soup they bring out before your meal is delicious as well . everything tastes made to order , always fresh never greasy , and is presented beautifully . the staff is very friendly and attentive . definitely try this place ! it 's a regular lunch spot for my office . they also have great lunch specials . :)"
2,"sky harbor is one poor gateway to the city of phoenix and the valley of the sun .   it is outdated , super crowded , it feels dirty and it is the home of us airways , the biggest carrier in and out of this airport . 

 terminal 4 is configured rather poorly .   the terminal reminds me of a backwards e , like the second e in emin3 m , except that there is another prong to the backwards e.   the concourses are not spacious at all , the seating limited , and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas . 
 .  
 to go from one end of terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the e.   it is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space .   the distances are long , the bruises will be many , either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights . 

 the other thing that must be mentioned is that sky harbor is not a business person 's airport but rather a tourist airport .   i think that contributes a lot to the chaos .   when an airport is full of amateurs , like sky harbor , there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places .   further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year , not just summer in their native habitats of the upper midwest . 

 get going on the remodel since it is long overdue and make sure you take in mind the tourists and the business traveler when updating this airport ."
4,i took my son who has been living in sweden to angels since he likes good beer .   and he was noy disappointed .   the price was right for the quality of the beer .   we also enjoyed the food i had the sweet potatoe tacos and the were great .   he loved that so many varieties of good beers were on tap .   definitely going again especially if all three of my son 's are home .    good beer good food good people
4,been to a few different locations and this one by far is the best one . the food seems better than the others .
4,"perhaps a bit on the pricey side , but sometimes you pay for atmosphere . this very sexy and trendy joint is located at city north ( next to blue martini ) . i ordered the # 1 sirloin burger with carmelized onions , gorgonzola , crescenza ( soft , buttery cheese ) , arugula & thousand island dressing . omg ! it was massive and juicy and made me lose all dining diplomacy as the juices dripped down my arm ! my friend built his own w/ hickory bbq sauce , cheddar and bacon . 

 on the side we had onion rings , sweet potatoe fries mixed w/ reg fries . errrr .... lemme make sure my gym membership is still active ! ! lol 

 personally , and i know this will cause a small uproar , i think the burgers are far better than delux ! i never understood the delux cult following anyway . there ... i said it ! :) 

 i even endulged in the guinnes milkshake ( guinness beer / vanilla bean & chocolate ice cream ) ! you know the saying do n't knock it til you try it??this would be one of those times . when 's the last time you had a sugar high and a buzz at the same time off a desert .... hmmm ? ? 

 bon appetite !"
1,"i had n't been to fuddruckers for about 20 years ... now i know why .   cashier was nice and very helpful .   i ordered bacon cheese burger combo .   fries were only warm , not hot .   burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits ... you know the ones that stick between your teeth .   lots of trash on the floor .   after we were finished , someone came to ask how things were .   i told here about the fries and she offered to get me more ; i declined .   she offered a free dessert : i accepted .   in all , not a good experience , will probably be at least another 20 years before i go back ."
3,"i may have to disagree with the majority of reviews of this restaurant . 

 we came here after my parents played a round of golf . with their round they got two free steak dinner , which they raved about ... not sure if it was more on the fact that they were tasty or that they were free , which today can be just as exciting . 

 i ordered the coconut shrimp with sweet potato fries , and although this is a large plate of fried concoctions , it was delicious ! i could not ask for a more crispy , summer - y meal . 

 there were some problems with the service , we had a dirty glass and a bad glass of wine . but they were very helpful in recognizing their fault and fixing the problem . 

 there was karaoke playing the night we were there , which was interesting , but not the creme of the crop participants if you catch my drift . 

 so if you are a   golfer and looking for a great place to go after your round , stop by ."
3,"jack in the box , this one in particular , is busiest from 10pm-2am . it definitely a "" better when your drunk "" kind of place , or at least i think it is from the number of drunk patrons i see eating there . 

 the food ? well , it 's jitb , what do you expect ? you got the 99 cent for 2 tacos deal , which is a must add for any meal . you also have breakfast served all day . this means you can get a extreme sausage sandwhich , 2 tacos , and a chicken fajita pita in the same meal . that 's some good eatin ' . please note that nothing about the chicken fajita pita is remotely close to an actual fajita . 

 this location specializes in making your food not look like it does in the picture . the picture may show a big fluffy bun with a juicy burger , however your burger will probably look like someone stepped on it then ran it over with their car . it does n't change the taste , tho . still tastes exactly like you would expect something to taste from jitb. i mean , it 's good food and a good value . by "" good "" food , i of course mean greasy and unhealthy . that is the definition of good food though , right ?"
5,"great little restaurant .   the staff is super friendly , and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing .   i got thepanko crusted tipalia which was a little dry , but my girlfriend 's stuffed mahi mahi was delicious .   the horchata bread pudding was really good too .   they have a nice patio where most of the customers sit , i will be bringing my dog with me next time .  

 it is a bit expensive , so be prepared to drop some money , but it 's definitely worth checking out ."
4,"i stayed at the firesky resort before taking my mcat and have mixed feelings about my stay . now granted , i had extremely high anxiety at the time so perhaps i did n't get to see the full glory of this place , but in my opinion it is somewhat overrated . for the price i paid , i expected more . 

 the resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex . in fact , i am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort . with that said , however , the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal . they are stylish , comfortable , and luxurious without being ostentatious . 

 my room was a little bit less impressive though . it had most of the amenities that i expected , but nothing extra . the artwork was n't overly impressive and the linens were just average . also , the tv was small . it certainly was n't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort . 

 the deck / balcony area was very nice though and i was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions . 

 if you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything , the firesky fits the bill . however , do n't expect to be wowed by your room . it is an average room . nothing less , nothing more ."
3,ordered spanikopita and greek salad . spanny was doughy and greek salad lacked a kick . unlike any greek i 'd had before . not going back .
4,"what a cool store ! the wife and i spent 3 hours poking around here , ended up ordering their "" cat mapper "" recliner ( my new throne ! ) . i do n't hunt anymore and rarely have time to fish , but i still love this store !"
4,"their quinoa veggie burger is the best veggie burger i 've had in a long time . it 's not dry , it 's flavorful and has texture to it . this is a place where i consciously choose to make room for dessert . the bread pudding is amazing , it 's light , it 's fluffy , it 's sweet but not * just * sweet . you know how some desserts just seem to have only one taste setting and they might as well have brought you a huge pile of sugar ? the souffle is delicious as well . nice atmosphere ,   relaxed but classy ."
5,this place is heavenly ! ! ! i have dreams about it on a regular basis . the cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors . tasty !
1,"bad experience ... terrible service , terrible food . 

 first of all , i was organizing a happy hour and dinner for a retirement party that we had on friday , august 3rd , 2012 .   reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area , although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area .   one of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices . it turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour , but the attendee that spoke with the manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices . 

 second of all , our server was awful .   there were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people .   anyways , she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed , rushed , rushed .   then a new person came in late on our table , and she was not even served when she saw her .   we had to track her down . i am sorry but the amount of restaurants that i have been to , this was the worst service ever .   i mean i had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived . 

 i ordered full size of fried green tomatoes , 1/2 order of fried okra , and a plate of sweet potato fries .   the server gave me my fried green tomatoes , but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible .   so i had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful .   the server took it away without even asking me if i wanted another batch . i do n't cook much , but i probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant . i told the server i ordered 1/2 size of fried okra , and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order .  

 and lastly , when the server gave us the bill , it was all separate checks and did not even do that right .   the server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check . 

 so needless to say ... i am not coming back to this restaurant again ."
4,"surprised by unexpected north phoenix location .   attentive but not bothersome service . antipasto platter shared among 3 people plenty for all .   the chianti was splendid ! the entre arrived piping hot , very impressive .   the food was delicious .   lovely intimate dining . reccommend . 
  only down side was it became so dim , had a hard time reading menu .   a bit more uplighting , please ."
4,"food is good .   service is pretty good . 

 its a restaurant that definitely reminds you of la , as it is very loud in there . 

 definitely will go back ."
2,""" trendy , loud - music , ok - sushi ! "" - 2/5 

 when we lived right across the street from the sushi brokers , j and i used to go there at least once a month for its happy hour . we probably had been there at least 8 times with friends and family . i have to say that the quality was good for the start but went downhill since then . the price was right if you go during the happy hour . other time , kinda expensive with the quality and service . it was a seen - to - be - seen place with ok - quality sushi ."
5,"my wife and i finally tried cph and were greatly surprised by everything .   the food , as expected , was superior along with the professionalism of the staff .   the ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably .  
 we began the nigth with a bottle of wine , the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp .   all were exceptional !   as out main courses , my wife orded the sea scallops and i ordered the short ribs .   ( peter of cowboy ciao 's must miss this guy . )   both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone .   for dessert , we had coffee and the evening 's special , the donut holes with three dipping sauces .   all were fantastic .   the wife and i do n't usually rate places with five stars , but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one .   ca n't wait until we head back ."
5,best prices and a huge selection . i love their single bottles of beer isle where you can mix and match your own 6-pack of beer . some of my favorite beers i can only find here .
4,"good time . we sat at the sushi bar and were entertained . we brought my 9 year old very picky daughter and she had fun . she has some edamame and a plate of plain noodles . sticking me for 5 bucks for a small pile of plain noodles i felt was outrageous . sushi was good and rolls were fantastic . asked the sushi chef to make his favorite and it was a spicy tuna roll with a sweet sauce that was awesome . we 'll come back , but i 'll give me daughter a hot dog before we go ."
5,"i ca n't believe this was n't reviewed yet !   this place rocks , and dr. heather is the very best vet in town . she 's reasonable in price , thorough in her evaluations , and super kind . she handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly , and she talks about her own pets and has compassion ! 

 when our cat everett died , she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process , but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint "" ornament "" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift .   never had a vet do anything so kind .  

 we have had many cats and many vets .   i know a good vet . go here . please go here !"
5,probably my favorite restaurant :)
3,i am not going to complain about the quality of my manicure ! they did a fabulous job ... on the other hand their customer service was a little off . very unorganized and they could just not get it together . it took them forever to assist us since we did n't have an appointment and are not regulars .
5,"i 've been giving a lot of 5-star reviews lately , but ( in my opinion ) they all deserve it .  

 movies on central rules .   they have 99.9 % of every movie title we 've looked for .   since summer started , we 've been in there at least once a week .   bonus :   they have a water cooler right by the door .   sweet !"
4,i really enjoy the food here . great breakfast fare . great prices . great service . the pancakes are really good . i still wonder why people go to dennys .   this is wayyyyyy better .
5,"delicious food , amazing martini 's , and wonderful desserts . every dish i have eaten here has been nothing short of awesome . first , to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas . you can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in . appetizers are not overly filling - the frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things . the coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch . the same is true with the mozzarella . the cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect . 

 as far as entrees go , the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful . the pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu . i love the simplicity of some and the complexity of others . finally , desert has always been good . try the limoncello cheesecake or any flavor of gelato and you certainly wo n't be disappointed ."
3,"ruby tuesday 's salad bar and healthier choices ( with caloric count for calorie counters ) for entrees is what sets it apart from other chain restaurants that serve your basic american style cuisine .   the salad bar includes 2 types of base greens ( iceberg and mixed greens ) , with various toppings ( edamame , peas , mushrooms , croutons etc . ) and dressings ( italian , low fat balsamic , ranch , thousand island , etc ) .  

 generally , with any main entree , you will have your choice of side and salad bar , or 2 sides .   they also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli .   my husband had the chicken trio , and i had the creole fish on our visit .   the chicken was nicely presented , and was fairly tender and juicy .   of the three different toppings ( balsamic and tomato , mushroom cheese , and mango salsa ) , my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it , while fresh , was n't totally ripe .   the creole fish was presented in a spartan way , with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate .   the fish ( some type of white fish , maybe carp ? ) was a freshwater white - flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well . 

 service was friendly , but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us .   drinks were refilled quickly as needed . 

 i have n't indulged in a lot of the desserts , but i am a fan of the italian creme cake .   it 's moist , and not too sweet .  

 prices are moderate , and entrees will be around 15 dollars , give or take a few dollars ."
1,"the only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste .   the smallest wings i have ever seen , they must be off of baby chicks .   i thought it was getting punked , actually lol .   never to be back"
5,"absolutely loved this place ! my fiance and i came across the arrogant butcher while we were in phoenix celebrating my birthday and our engagement . my fiance had found it on yelp and said "" we must go there for lunch one day "" while we were there . we ended up going here for my birthday dinner , after a "" higher end "" establishment could n't accomodate my gluten allergy . the food , the drinks and the waitstaff were great ! it was so good , we went back the next day !"
3,"dear yelp : why ca n't there be a 3.5 star rating ?   i wanted to give this place 4 stars , but will have to wait for another visit to bump it up . 

 i have never been here before , so i consulted with my fellow yelpers for their input .  

 the service was quick and prompt .   our waitress was friendly and on top of things .   i was impressed by the selection of beer , although small , with an offering of alaskan amber ale ... mmmm . 

 we decided to keep things simple this trip .   12 wings , medium flavor , one large margherita pizza with garlic on 1/2 .  

 goods : i love the mozzarella that they use !   i have never tasted cheese this cheesy or this good on my pizza .   no joke .   the wing sauce was also delicious and they provided you with a perfect amount of sauce to cover the wings .   and , the ranch was not watered down , which i am traditionally used to . 

 bads :   the parking lot sucks .   we had to park across the street from their main lot to find a spot .   also , the tomatoes on the pizza were unripe .   our pizza was soggy in the center , perhaps from the tomato juice during the cooking process , and it made for bad leftovers in the microwave the next day . 

 so , with the combination of the both , i will definitely say that i shall return to give them another sampling in due time , and perhaps bump up that star to where i think it should be in the back of my mind ."
4,"i am so in love with the exceptional level of service provided at this diamond in the rough naturopathic clinic ! it may not look like much from the outside . inside the unsurpassed warmth and tenderness is ideal for a deeply enriching , healing experience . i was gifted a 90 minute massage and was not disappointed . the masseuse was knowledgeable and hyper receptive to my needs . i walked in trapped in a bubble of negativity . when i left i was literally floating ... i felt cleansed and utterly flawless . another major plus was that the entire indulgent , spirit lifting experience was under $ 40 . a professional , extraordinary 90 minute massage for under $ 40 ? ! seriously go for it !"
3,"this place needs a face - lift , the whole concept and decor is outdated and needs some help . i think their sushi and other food items are alright , although they try to be so trendy and in reality there menu is pretty blah . its a fun place to grab a drink and sit on the patio , but the excitement and trendiness of this place is completely gone ."
5,"great little hole in the wall with authentic new mexican food .   chili relleno was awesome , and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy .   rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious . atmosphere was cozy .   if you want real red and green chile vs. sauce this is the place ."
5,"the food in this place is indescribably awesome ! granted , the place could be nicer , but if you 're in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place : this is it . the service is fast , friendly , and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge . i ca n't finish my plate most of the time , so i always end up taking leftovers home . 
 i love their jade red chicken , as well as their emerald chicken . their black beans are to die ! order a combo plate , if this is your first time here . you 'll get a good mix of everything and you 'll leave without regrets !"
3,great dive bar . great jukebox
5,"we were in town for the weekend and i had a cigar at this lounge .   the cigar prices are reasonable and i did nt mind paying $ 9 for a la gloria wavelle .   service was good and the atmosphere was nice and chill .   my wife does nt smoke cigars and the air circulation was good , no lingering smoke .   we met some nice people and the lounge singers were a plus .   we will come back next time we visit , i wish we had something like this in la ."
4,"stopped in with my two yr old granddaughter today after going to the children 's museum , got some raised eyebrows when the cool people   saw the kid but whatever i had to have one of there dirty chai 's . good as usual and the kiddo had a cupcake she thoroughly enjoyed on the drive home ."
5,"best italian restaurant in the valley , as far as i 'm concerned . totally unassuming from the outside since it 's in a strip center on 64th st. & greenway ( in the same center as fry 's and mcdonalds ) . but this family run restaurant that has been here for years . same friendly staff every time ... especially love being in the bar area . a little on the pricey side , but definitely worth it . must try the ravioli ( either as an appetizer or main dish ) and chicken marsala with fettuccine alfredo on the side . all entrees come with soup or salad ."
5,"amanda at butterfly petals did the flowers for my wedding . i did nt want to spend   a lot on them and shaved it down to only needing my bouquet , three boutonnieres and two corsages . i told her what i liked and did nt and my budget . she created a bunch of options for me based on my specifics so i had a   number of choices . she also did all of this via email . which i give her total kudos for . 

 on the day of my wedding , there was a fabulous bouquet waiting for me as well as perfect corsages and boutonnieres for my groom and our parents . amanda waited for me , even though i was terribly late , to make sure i was happy with her creations which really gave a personal touch . 

 butterfly petals is creative and affordable . i love my bouquet so much that i ended up keeping it and i am having it preserved !"
4,it 's like paradise bakery but with a more diverse and far better menu .
5,"i stopped by a friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review . i 've had donuts since then from other donut shops , but none compare to bosa . the price and quality at bosa are far superior to all others . you ca n't go wrong with the donut holes ."
5,one of my favorite places to eat if i 'm looking for cheap and fast :)
4,"one of my new favorite neighborhood bars ! 

 we had a canada day shindig here and it 's a great little neighborhood bar with fair drink prices and super friendly bar staff . you 'd never know that there 's a bar inside when you get to the parking lot behind the ice rink - just look for the signs on the top of the building . 

 they have lots of tvs for hockey fans and the bar looks right out onto the ice so you can watch people skate . they had a great jukebox and the rockband kit so you can rock out with all your newest bar friends . 

 for food selection you have bbq , bbq , or bbq ... either beef , pork , or chicken , with a side for $ 6.50 . tasty stuff ! great beer selection including molson canadian or labatt blue ."
1,"i went here with friends last friday .   all my friends and i use yelp , at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 1 star place .   it was a huge disappointment after looking at the positive reviews .   our 1st disappointment came because they had a "" limited "" beer list .   my good buddy just wanted an ipa and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones .   then , the spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible .   we had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry .   the calamari was extremely oily .   the only positive thing was the lamb chops but once you factor in price that was poor too .   we all came to the conclusion we would never go back ."
3,"lately , i 've been on the hunt for a good shrimp po boy . i 'm not sure if this compulsion was spurred by homesickness for new orleans , the food challenge show featuring 2 famous nola po boy joints , or both but i 've it seems the last few weekends i 've found myself dreaming of that crusty bread "" dressed "" with lettuce , tomato , and mayo , and golden deep fried gulf shrimp . i happened to notice baby k 's one day and decided to try it out . to be honest , i was n't even really that hungry but i wanted the po boy and i did n't know when or if i 'd have the opportunity to go back to town and country mall any time in the near future . the inside was empty but they have a french 
 quarter - esque patio complete with wrought iron fence . the bf and i both ordered the half pb with a cup of gumbo . i 'm a bit of a gumbo snob bc i feel i can make it better than any restaurant can but theirs was really good ! they had 3 different kinds which was nice and it was seasoned perfectly . there was n't a bite that did n't have meat in and the broth was just right . the shrimp on the pb was succulent and almost tasted as if it was battered in beignet mix as the fried was light and airy . i did n't indulge in any libations but they do have abita and a few other new orleans beer classics . if i find myself in the area again i 'd probably go back but this time i 'm ordering a whole po boy !"
4,"went for my birthday and anniversary , and i was pleased by both the service and the food .   the waiter let me try a   piece of prime rib , since i 'd never had it before ( i know , what have i been missing ? ! ? ! ) , so kudos for going out of his way . 

 another nice touch was the manager personally coming over to introduce herself and ask about our experience . 

 overall the service was great , and the food , while tasty , was n't spectacular or terribly distinguished .   i probably would n't come here too often , mainly due to price , unless i have more birthday coupons ."
1,"walk the other way , just walk right the hell the other way ... 

 here was how this played out .   oktoberfest a few days ago .   starting the night off .   i walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for $ 1.99 .   good , right ?   no .  

 me : "" hi , one slice of pizza please "" 
 guy : "" you buy drink with it , 4 dollars . "" 
 me : "" no , just one slice of pizza "" 
 guy : "" we do not sell one slice , you have to buy a drink .   4 dollars "" 

 i should have pulled a flag on this play at this point , but knowing i was going to be drinking i move forward wanting food in me . not a wise move . 

 me : "" so , i ca n't buy one slice ? "" 
 guy : "" no , you buy a drink with slice , 4 dollars . "" 
 me : "" it does n't say that anywhere on the menu or walls "" 
 guy : "" no , do not sell one slice . 
 me : "" what the ... o.k. , give me 2 slices of pizza "" 
 guy : "" you buy two slices then . "" 
 me : "" yes , jesus christ , yes "" 
 guy : "" toppings ? "" 
 me : "" no , no toppings .   cheese . "" 
 guy : "" we have toppings . "" 

 what is this guy , fucking deaf ? 

 me : "" no thanks "" 

 i give him the money . 

 guy : "" it take 10 minutes , you wait . "" 

 i do n't think they run the air conditioner in this place , so i wait outside . 

 pizza comes out .   tastes like absolute crap .   i eat it outside because in september in chandler arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place .   i think they had the thermostat set to "" hell "" guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as i am eating .   i 'm sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one .   excuse me , avoid having to pay for two .   however after what i had served to me i 'm pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul .   i was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food .   would n't eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions .   i 'd keep walking . 

 fail ."
5,"jeremiah is great ! he is very friendly , patient , and knows what he 's doing ! 

 we started off with the drunken cheesy bread , it 's ok . not something i would want again . nothing wrong with it , just not my taste . 

 for lunch , i had the chicken parmesan sandwich , along with a house salad . the sandwich is great . loved it . 
 the house salad ... i mean , i could not stop eating it . i have no idea which kind of dressing was on it , but it was amazing . i am craving it just thinking about it . 

 the interior is very clean , roomy , very casual . i heard they have great happy hour , so i will be back again ."
1,"mediocre , bland , low quality food topped off with painfully slow service .   i worked in the neighborhood and continued to return occasionally "" just in case it 's gotten better "" , for reasons i could never fathom once the plate of abysmal food was placed on the table .   the salsa and rice are usually good , but that 's the most i have to offer ."
3,"i give this place 3 stars because of how friendly the lady that worked there was and how amazing their prices were . it was pretty unorganized though and i am sure that it is due to people moving books to where they should n't be and there just being too many books to keep organized . it is not a bad book store at all , just be prepared to have to dig and dig for what you are looking for . worth it though for the prices :)"
4,"more expensive than some of the other nearby locations ( $ 5 military lot next door ) the shuttle was nice and quick shuttle despite odd hours of the night . nice enough , they also accepted competitor coupons when the lot with the deal was full . the boyfriend and i had a great experience and prompt service at all hours of the night . it also seems more secure . loved it !"
2,"i recently went to the breakfast club for the first time with a good friend who i had n't seen in awhile . it was a weekday and so , while it was still busy , we did n't have to wait to be seated . the food was good , but slightly over - priced . my biggest problem with the restaurant - the service . they were slow to deliver our drinks and food , yet once our food came , they were swarming around like bees every five minutes to take our plates so we could get out of there . i felt like they did n't care at all for the fact that i was having a nice morning with a good friend but instead wanted us to pay and leave . after we had been there for just over an hour and fifteen minutes , out waitress actually told us to leave the table and finish our conversation outside so they could seat other customers . we were mortified . i have never been asked to leave a restaurant in my life . needless to say , they did n't win a loyal customer with me ."
5,"recently was invited to this restaurant & found out that they have children 's plates for adults or any age . 

 it was super cheap & it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc . 

 what a deal ! 

 under 5 . bucks including the drink . 

 i will definitely   be going back   to any cracker barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc . or just about anywhere ."
4,"i really like this place ! plenty of room , very organized . and is willing to help you out . price is very acceptable @ $ 7.00 a day . they have ear plugs , targets and beverages to purchase at a reasonable price . if it 's your first time there is a 10 min video they want you to watch . it 's diffidently a great place to go , just have to watch out for dumb a$ $ like myself . i tend to have a major brain freeze . but the workers there are nice enough to let me know what i did wrong in a polite way . give me time ! i promise i wo n't shoot anyone ! i 'll get better ."
5,"this is   the best asian restaurant in town ! previously shanghai palace , this out of the way restaurant serves up some of the best curry and pad thai , that i have ever tasted in my life ! the panang curry is so savory and aromatic , literally one of the best things i have ever had . i honestly crave this dish about twice a week . 
 also any thing on the menu can be made vegetarian this is a huge bonus for all veggie 's around town ! 
  the chef - owner tottie kaya , is always very hospitable . she walks around to each table making sure everything is up to standard . i have never once had a bad experience at this delicious eatery . so if you love asian cuisine , you must dine at tottie 's !"
5,"best pizza i 've had anywhere .   perfect , perfect and i mean perfect crust .   thin , chewy , smoky and sweet .   lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh , local produce .   i deeply envy the regulars here ."
5,"y'know , rarely do i buy the "" extended warranty "" that most places try to peddle on you nowadays . if you buy the item from a reputable manufacturer , it should be unnecessary . 

 in the case of tires , i have to make an exception . 

 you can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car , but not the quality of construction workers who do n't know how to secure their nails , screws and bolts for travel on highways , streets and other local thoroughfares . they 're a nefarious bunch for the most part . i 'm not for extra taxes , but i 'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive ... and stiff penalties / massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway . 

 for the second time in a year , one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw , mind you , but a bolt .   i pulled my receipts from the glove compartment , used yelp to find the nearest discount tire , and called for a tow . 

 the replacement certificates i got were $ 16 per tire ( back in nc , but they 're good here too ) , and worth every penny . the folks at this discount tire location were extremely nice , and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes ( with no appointment ) . there is even free water for customers . they were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it , which is fine ( as long as it holds ) . 

 every discount tire location i 've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you 're getting , the quality of customer service , and the wait . in a town of 4.3 million people and never - ending road construction , i have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires , no matter where you buy them . i prefer getting mine from dt ."
2,beer selection 10/10 however service is 1/10 . staff lacks product knowledge . specials are not mentioned . wait time is long . staff makes you feel like they are doing you a favor by taking your order .

3,"i 've grown to like apple , though i 've always thought their products were priced on the rich side .   when we lived in seattle there was a microsoft bias , but a large group of us all had apple iphones .   and that is a key part to the apple story .   you buy the iphone and then the next thing you know , you 're looking at ipads .  

 the genius bar is fun and very helpful when things go wrong ; like when my new phone duplicating one calendar entry 341 times .   i had to bring in my win - tel pc into the genius bar and in the end we had to delete mobileme to fix it .    but , absolutely great , great customer service ! ! ! 

 i love my new iphone 4 , and i 've had blackberries for 14 years !   maybe when they add facetime to the ipads , i 'll belly up to the genius bar ."
1,"pure fitness as a whole i like . no contracts , the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen , ( ex . la fitness ) . plus you get complimentary training sessions . however , this location i will never return to and its all because of their new gm adam . i had a free pass and he was the one that i had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session . i had already explained that i planned to join but he would n't stop the full court press of selling which i did nt like at all . i wanted to use my weeks free pass then join . he wanted me to give him money right then and there when he had nt so much as given me a tour yet ! anyway , i told him i wanted to wait and then he starts asking when i get paid , is it a money situation , etc .. if made me very uncomfortable . 

  i went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that i m not inactive but going to the gym is not something i ve done on a consistent basis in a very long time . now i enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me .. he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate . my arms were n't sore , i know sore , i m okay with sore but they became weak for five days , that i had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling , and it hurt to use a freakin ' date stamp at work ! 

 but the reason i m not going back .. i was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so i did . that way i would nt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc .   well i called adam to let him know and he went off on me .. just short of yelling . "" great , now i lose the commission the gym loses the points .. you can understand why i m upset right . "" and he went on for about 5 minutes . i was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he 's the gm ? ? ? if they work on commission they should give you a heads up "" hey i know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so i would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up "" . i would have respected that . or if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it does n't circumvent them . but i was floored and pissed that he came at me like that . 

 ps . of all the pure fitness this one is the smallest , visually unappealing and has the worst customer service . i did sign up and i love the one i go to now ... but this one i will never step foot in again"
4,"i have eaten here four or five times .   we always get the mussels to start , and they are always delicious and cooked just right .   the broth is great for dipping the bread in , although i could probably just use a straw .   the fish of the day was halibut .   it was very flavorful , but maybe just a tad overcooked .   the scallops were wonderful .   great wine selection .   this place a lively atmosphere .   not too noisy to hear across the table , but a good vibe .   the service was excellent ."
3,"i liked the fish .   it was delicious .   the cole slaw was also very tasty .   not too sweet .   a bit tangy .   i like that . 

   the shrimp was okay .   a bit rubbery , but then what does one might expect for a seafood place in the middle of a desert ? 

 my biggest problem with this place was the price of the food .   it is just too expensive for what amounts to frozen food plopped into a deep fryer .   i could buy frozen fish at the grocery store and then come home and plop it into my little deep fryer and it would taste about the same and be a lot cheaper .  

 i just wish it was n't so expensive .   especially considering this in the hood .   if you know what i mean .   i do n't mind driving down to the hood for some fried fish , but only if it is reasonably priced ."
2,"i 'm always searching for quality food at a fair price for lunch .   there are tons of sit down expensive lunch places and lots of fast food ( junk food ) places too .   when i read the reviews on chestnut lane i hustled right on over .   the concept is right on but the execution leaves a lot to be desired .  

 first challenge is getting a parking place and i was lucky .   the line to order did n't look too bad when i arrived so i was feeling lucky .   however , the line took forever to move forward causing the people waiting to shuffle back and forth in a very confined space as there was lots of foot traffic trying to enter and exit .   the woman at the register took each order , processed the payment , and then proceeded to prepare the drinks   and sides for each order .   the drinks are somewhat specialty items and are kind of labor intensive , especially considering that the order line is at a total standstill .   slow !   after way too long a wait , i finally was able to order ... then the real wait began !   it was a good 25 minutes before my order came up and it was just a turkey sandwich !   i felt lucky , though , as the woman ahead of me in line was still waiting for her sandwich after i had finished mine and was driving away ! 

 sometimes a long wait is mitigated by the awesomeness of the food .   well , at chestnut lane this is unfortunately not the case .   i mean it was a decent turkey sandwich , but when i saw the almost $ 16 charge for a turkey sandwich and iced tea i was expecting something fabulous .   it was n't all that .  

 if you decide to go to chestnut lane , maybe you could park in the spacious jack - in - the box lot just to the east .   and grab a breakfast jack to hold you over during your long wait !"
2,i was expecting more since there are so many 5 star reviews on yelp . three friends and i tried rokerij for the first time on saturday . we had a reservation for 6:30 . the specials are on a blackboard above your head behind you if you are seated in the booths . you have the practically get out to read them . the paper menus have a lot of abbreviations so you have to keep remembering what the letters mean . i do n't want to work that hard . ca n't you just spell out the words ? i ordered the surf and turf from the richardson 's side of the menu . what was delivered was an unappetizing mess . the plate and everything on it was covered in a chili sauce . it looked like dog food with a piece of steak in the middle . really it was a terrible presentation . my husband 's plate looked the same . the other two at our table ordered from the rokerij side and at least it looked a lot better . the two bacon wrapped shrimp were flavorful and my steak was over cooked for medium but ok . i could have skipped the messy beans or at least they could put them in a cup . i may try them again but just for happy hour and i 'll keep the rokerij side of the menu .
4,"great ! came here with my girlfriend and my mom and left very satisfied ! we ordered some of there apparently famous bruschetta , some panini and a bottle of their zweigel wine from austria and it was all fantastic ! i highly recommend going there and at least getting some wine and bruschetta if nothing else , it is well worth you time ! 

 keep singing ,

4,"i went to saba 's feeling a little scared .   fast food greek in a strip mall ?   this could go one of two ways ... surprisingly good or health code violation bad .  

 i am very glad to say it did n't end being the latter .   in fact , the food here was pretty damn good .   i did expect saba 's to be an order at the counter joint , so i was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant .   i like my greek fast and cheap , okay ?   but i got over it , got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order . 

 the menu has all the normal greek items , including falafel- little fried balls of joy i might add- gyros , vegetarian platters , spanakopita and dolmas .   prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap , but when you venture into the platter territory , you 're going to pay for it . platters start around $ 10 and go up .   i ordered the falafel , of course , and so did my boyfriend .   the pita sandwiches do n't come with any sides , so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal . 

 the dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of greece all over the walls and the classic greek music piped in .   unfortunately , not even the greek music could mask the hideous , loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me . he was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud , even the half - deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him .   he was so loud i felt like i should respond to his questions .   hey moron- saying things like "" i like it loose , like my women , "" is just not funny . 

 anyways , when we finally got our food , it was really good .   the falafel pita and the fries were tasty , but our server sucked .   he obviously knew the loud tool , and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check .   that was a little annoying , but overall , saba 's is a good choice for a quick greek meal ."
4,"i love the penang curry at the thai house ! better than any other place i 've had . too , the lunch special is one of the best deals in town . the spring rolls are pretty good , although i 'm not crazy about the sauce , it 's a bit too thick and sticky for my liking . the service is okay , during lunch they could use additional help , servers are literally jogging to service their tables . overall , it 's a great spot - i 'm definitely eating there a few times a month if not more ."
5,"love the food and the services , but you neesd to weight at 350ib to eat the burgers for free , the burgers are big and jucey"
5,"i just started taking my car here a few months ago . someone from their business stopped by my office building with donuts and coupons for a 60,000 mile check up , and that 's how they got my business . 

 i brought my car there for a routine oil change , and they did the 60,000 mile check up which was very useful . of course there was the usual list of things i should fix , but they never made me feel like an idiot or that they were taking advantage of me , which i ca n't say for most mechanics . 

 the other thing i really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work , so i can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how i 'm going to get back to the shop . 

 bill and the other guys that work there are all very friendly and i definitely trust them with my car needs ."
4,"i was in scottsdale from california with some friends to catch the end of dodgers spring training and to get in a couple of rounds of golf .   we came here wanting to watch the lakers game , but unfortunately , they do n't have the nba package so we had to settle on watching the suns game on espn . 

 my friends and i ordered the fried clams , a salad and three burgers .   we all thought the food was good as well as the service .   drinks were tasty and our server heather was very attentive and was always coming by to make sure we were well taken care of .   we 'll definitely come back !"
3,been closed for a long time .
3,it 's pei wei . the service and food are always satisfactory .
2,hostess staff were a few unorganized morons-- it appeared as if it was literally their first night on the job . maybe too many of them ? the service was fast but i would n't say friendly . she made a few mistakes with our order-- gave my daughter a cheese pizza when we ordered pepperoni ..   she put a glass right in front of my 22 mo old who grabbed it right away of course-- few other rookie mistakes like that . calamari- gross . lobster / crab tacos with white bland rice-- do n't order it . my husband was happy with ribeye and atmosphere is cool and clean .
5,"postinos on the east side ! ? 

 whoa , you like to think that you 're immune to postinos , oh yeah 
 it 's closer to the truth to say i ca n't get enough 
 you know i 'm gon na have to face it , i 'm addicted to postinos 

 thanks robert palmer and let 's just say i would n't be surprised to see the fashion models around here .   very attractive crowd !   i am honor just to be here !  

 another bottle of wine and you 'll be mine , a one track mind 
 i ca n't be saved 
 4 flavors of bruschetta is all i crave 
 if there 's some left for you 
 and do n't mind if i do 

 i might as well face it i 'm addicted to postinos 

 i 've always enjoyed attending postinos on the west side of town , but the east side adds a new flavor .   the place still has a great deal on monday and tuesday nights .   bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschetta 's for $ 20 !   the ambience is always chill and low lighting .   quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and i 'm golden here !   service is always great at postinos .   the staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular ! - enjoy !"
5,"rula bula gets five stars from me for two reasons : 

 # 1 perfect fish and chips . 
 # 2 one of the only correctly poured guinness drafts in az . 

 they could punch me in the neck when i walked in , and i would still give them five stars for those two reasons . 

 almost all the food is good ( though i can count the number of times i 've had anything other than the above on one hand ) . the happy hour is great , with half off appetizers , including the fish nuggets , which are the fish ' n ' chips i eat before i eat the fish ' n ' chips . 

 the world 's most competitive trivia night . these people study for trivia night . 

 great outdoor seating , good service . decor is interesting , especially if you like this particular famous race horse that i currently forget the name of but is the subject of approximately 90 % of the wall art ."
2,"in a word : kitsch . 

 this 50 's palace of pink serves up a number of ice cream dishes , including favorites such as banana splits and brownie sundaes as well as build your own creations .   the ice cream itself was underwhelming , i was expecting a homemade recipe , but was a little surprised when i saw tubs of dreyers being brought into the front dining room . 

 given it 's location in old town scottsdale , a venerable dumping ground of knick knacks galore , sugar bowl was exactly what i expected in terms of decor and atmosphere , kitsch , kitsch and more kitsch . 

 where is gelateria parmalat when you need it ?"
4,great flatbreads and atmosphere
4,"i still really like the studio movie grill , but sat in the "" general admission "" seats last night for the first time , and found that they were not nearly as comfortable as the "" reserved "" seats with their own little tables .   unfortunately . 

 the ga seats are also quite tightly shoved together , so if it is a full house you are bumping up against your neighbor , and it is distracting . 

 best bet :   go to a un - crowded movie and sit in one of the reserved seats that is not pre - reserved ( not pre - sold , and does n't have the little "" reserved "" sign on it ) to enjoy the reserved seats at the ga price ."
5,"simply awesome ! great beer and great staff ! will try the food next time ! only complaint is a bartender named adrianne she is crazy ! ha ! g 

 the food was excellent from the great hard boiled egg dish to the peanut butter and jelly with banana and marshmallow fluff oh and add bacon .   elvis just did a sommersault in his grave .   the sandwiches are not huge but they are all made like the beer served and the people hosting , of finest quality !  

 really enjoyed and will spread the word !"
5,"after visiting family in scottsdale last weekend , hubby and i spent 3 wonderful days at the boulders resort in carefree . we arrived a little tired and stressed ; we left tan , relaxed , and rejuvenated . 

 the resort sprawls beneath the boulder formations , but you can walk all over on the paths that are well marked . our room was spacious and clean , with his and hers sinks in the bathroom , shower , tub , king sized bed , and walk - in closet . we were located near the main lodge , and a brisk walk from el pedregal and the golden door spa . we made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well- yoga , bosu , and water fitness . 

 we tried both pools during our stay , the spa pool and the main pool . we preferred the tranquility of the spa pool ; food and drinks at both locations were exceptional . if you meet madonna at either pool , ask her to make the "" madonna special "" for you . a very refreshing smoothie . 

 during our stay we ate dinner twice at the spotted donkey cantina at el pedregal- fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos . our last night we dined at rusty 's chop house at the golf club . it was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course . 

 every person we ran into was exceptionally friendly and genuine , making the trip even more enjoyable . i hope we return someday !"
5,"this place is what desert ridge wishes it was ! its great for groceries ( wal - mart ) , bargain hunting ( tj maxx ) , fast food or dining in ( tons of places ! ) , catching a movie ( harkins ) , stocking up the wine shelf ( bevmo ) , new panties ( vicky 's secret ) and a zillion other things . i love that this is close to my house ! the only thing that would make it better is a costco or sam 's club ."
3,"3.5 stars . needed a place to avoid the rain before going to see tron with my mom at the movie theater next door . we did n't order food , just drinks . there 's an osf in seattle , and having gone a couple times , while not super familiar with the menu , i know what they serve . our waitress was actually really awesome- she got us our drinks quickly and was super friendly with our touristy butts . yeah ... it 's a chain . i know the food is n't the best and the service can be hit or miss . but the stars are all for our waitress , whose name i ( of course ) ca n't remember . i got the osf version of a jack and coke , which had a cherry infused whiskey ( it was dangerous , and at 7 dollars , doubly so ) , and my mom got a virgin daquiri- our waitress put extra whip on it . a little touch , but one my mom really appreciated ."
5,"dr. jason kanarish is absolutely amazing .   i am a physician assistant in surgery , and   appreciated his "" bedside "" manner as well as medical knowledge , which was phenomenal .   he spent ample time with me and answered every question i had .   not to mention , he was fantastic with my scared min pin . i can not recommend him enough .   the staff is also extremely friendly and helpful !"
5,"awesome resort .   i was able to stay there to celebrate a birthday in july , and fortunately it was n't as hot as it usually is .   i am a wimp when it comes to heat , but the resort was wonderful , even with many things being closed .   the summer is off season for this spot .   we had a great time at the spa , and lying by the pool .   be sure to have your food and drinks served there .   it feels so luxurious ."
4,"when i 'm looking for the more mature , laid back version of lux , i come to copper star . coffee is not as good but service is great and place is inviting . great neighborhood favorite ."
5,"in times of big corporations it was nice to find such a warm and friendly coffeehouse in the valley . it is just a great place to hang out , set - up your laptop or read a book . i thoroughly enjoyed my joltachinno , a much better version of the starbucks frappacino which is just too sweet . 
 we came back another day for lunch and all i can say is yum ! i have never had food like this at a coffeehouse . 
 amazingly , for our second time there , they recongnized us ! wow !   i am glad that i have found my new hangout when i come to the valley !"
5,"i 've always been partial to harkins theaters because they have the best seats .   i used to say , "" you know what would be the best theater ?   amc experience , with harkins seats .. "" 

 guess what .. amc westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that .   i love this place .   it 's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it .   not to mention an imax .   the experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable . 

 nothing really more to say that it 's a theater .   i do like the new stubs card that they put out .   yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it , but it 's only $ 12 a   year .   not bad for all the free stuff you get . 

 another cool thing about this theater is the location .   if you are going to grab dinner / lunch before hand , ther eis a ton of places to choose from . 

 nice work amc on making a great theater ! ! 

 ohhh big big big heads up .   be sure to see a movie before noon or ya get to pay nice big money .    that 's probably the draw back .   i 'll still give you 5 stars ."
3,"first of all , i have to give dos at least three stars just because it 's dos . i mean did going to dos make me feel old , yes , were there some interesting people there and not in a good way , yes , did i spend more money than i wanted to , yes , but all in all you always have a great time . nothin' but laughs . the giant jenga did n't suck either . 

 dos gringos is a staple among the youngins , as i like to call 'em . in college , one will totally fit in , however , now'a days it 's a place meant solely for people watching . and boy do you get an eye full . 

 drink 's are cheap , tacos are good , and the bathrooms are n't as scary as you would think . go ! have fun , get drunk .... but do n't expect anything classy ."
5,"i am giving ajo al 's on shae five stars because i 've been there regularly for about two years and it 's always good . now let me point out two issues : i 'm not a huge fan of mexican food , and i only get the tacos del mar or ono fajitas which are versions of the same thing . the chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa ( more peppery and hot ) . for appetizers the chili con queso dip and nachos are good sized and tasty . for a friend and i this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly . try it . 

 detail : 

 like i said i 'm not exactly a fan of mexican food . i like the americanized fast - ish food chains : qdoba , chipotle even baja fresh . i 've eaten at actual mexican restaurants in mexico and had home cooked mexican fish tacos and tamales . it 's growing on me but these are not tastes i grew up with . 

 i have a friend who loves ajo al 's , she lived next to it or something . so i pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and i liked it right away . like i said , i 've only really eaten the fish tacos but they 're the best i 've had . the fish is good , the sides are good , idk what chipotle cream is but it 's good , good service , the chip lady is nice , all the wait staff have been good . 

 it 's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full . i 've never waited to be seated though . i 've never tried the bar area . the water seams better than tap water ... a dumb observation but i usually drink water rather than soda so i mention that . they give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed . the chips and salsa are endless and excellent . service is always good . 

 two friends typically get the pollo con queso and swear it 's the best ever . i 've had it as left - overs and it 's good but not really my thing . 

 this is the only ajo al 's i 've been to ... no comment on the rest of this chain ."
5,"durants rocks .

 i love walking through the kitchen to get to the restaurant . 
 i love the garlicky cheesy bread that probably has a million calories in it . 
 i love the steaks . 
 i love the decor . 
 i love the bar . 

 we all ordered different items when we went here for dinner one night , and all raved about what we had .   i do n't think you can go wrong , no matter what you order .   it 's amazing , delicious , and very very unique ."
4,"what can i say ... the food and drinks were delicious and the atmosphere is sexy yet comfortable .   but the real stars of the show where the staff !   everyone was exceptional , funny and charming : a dashing maitre'd , a handsome and truly helpful waiter , the chef was warm and happy to explain their signature chinese oven even though i 'm sure he has to do that a thousand times a night and the support staff ... wonderful .   the water ninja is not to be missed ... this guy sneaks in and fills your glass with such speed and accuracy that water tension alone keeps the glass just slightly more than 100 % full .   this guy amazed us with his serving mastery again and again while his plate clearing partner in crime delighted us with a quick coin trick .   wonderful !"
5,"i love this place . the las vegas roll is amazing however the crispy california roll is n't that crispy . their sake is in fact bomb and the restaurant it always a good time . their prices are reasonable for sushi places in tempe and the service has always been awesome . if you 've got a party bigger than 4 though , call ahead ."
5,"one of my most favorite coffee shops ! location for sure . soooo cute here . inside and out . the patio is beautiful and you feel like you 're in a diff city for a moment . coffee is pretty darn good . not the best , but good . and the menu is great . i am a vegetarian and they have many options for us . the treats are amazing . the staff is amazing . and they always seem to play great music too . love this place . wish it were not so far away in mesa ..."
4,"i 'm a sucker for sweet potato fries !   any place serving this yummy delicious ingredient deserves my love .   i think i can survive off this for 30 days .... any reality tv show takers ... huh .. huh ?   well , over food was really excellent .   gourmet burgers are to die for are n't they ! ?   sorry carl 's jr ... your $ 6 burger -- really ?   i had the number 3 here - yeah sounds like a secret chinese sauce , but better !   my burger was cooked just right - juicy and medium - well .   the service was good and the atmosphere tries to re - enact modern hip fine dining .   though you probably would n't know the difference after a few bottles here :) - enjoy !"
4,"in 2006 , i returned to the p a m after a long absence .    i went to see a locally produced exhibit , ( judith leiber , ) which i thoroughly enjoyed and so i renewed my membership .    now at the time i was spending a good deal of time with my new granddaughter , jade and started to bring her to the events and exhibits .    her first time was to the cowboy artist of america and at the time she did not speak much , yet by the end of the event , she could say ; "" cowboys ! "" ( and the artists always make an effort to , draw upon her . )     since then i have seen rembrandt , special guests ; the tudor tailors , diego rivera ( with frida kahlo ) ,   author michael blake ( with his son ) and much more .   as far as being , good for kids ? !   my granddaughter , jade 's love of going to the p a m has made me a bigger fan than ever .   ~please view pictures~"
2,"two stars for bad service and , damn , i have to the tell the truth , a lousy appetizer .   had the braised leeks to start , which appeared to have been made less of leeks and more of a white cheese that i can only assume had been allowed to congeal into a rubbery mat beneath a heat lamp .   it was literally impossible to cut into bite - sized pieces , and was tasteless besides .  

 then , after at least a half an hour wait , pasta with chanterelles .   the shrooms were great , and i have to say i enjoyed fennel for the first time in my life , but the pasta was enormous in size and there was an awful lot of it . 

 but one of my friends had the fried green tomatoes , which were wonderful , and another had the brussell sprouts , also wonderful , and the butterscotch pudding dessert with the nutmeg whipped cream was simply divine . 

 they were very busy ( our reserved table was 20 minutes late and the seats were still warm when we sat down ) , so i 'm thinking they were just run off their feet .   i 'd give them another chance . 

 oh , and a delightful arizona sauvignon blanc .   i 'm told they serve only arizona wines , which is kinda cool .."
3,"fez ... the two times that i went it was in the afternoon on the weekend . both times , i was able to enjoy a great lunch with my sister and cousin and then again with my sister . the two dishes i liked were the fez burger and the casa blanca chicken .   the berry shortcake was good , however the water from the strawberries sort of killed the whipped cream and the shortcake ( biscuit ) was very good . 

 overall the environment during those times were peaceful and quiet . the staff offered advice on the menus . the price a little high for my wallet but i would definitely come back to splurge with great company in tow ."
4,"nice bowling alley .   i liked it alot and the staff was very helpful when we could not figure stuff out !   the flatscreens with the score were nice and the animation of pros were a nice upgrade . we came when their was a deal which was nice .   thursday- 5 buck cover and free shoes , dollar games , popcorn , beer , and hot dogs all night .... all i got ta say it\s that i did my damage !   the set up for finding a v\ball was far nicer than any other alley i have been to !   very out of thew way and easy to find what you need ! 
 very well lit alley with a fun atmosphere !"
5,"i love tasty kabob !   their food is always excellent , and i try to make it back there whenever i return to the valley .   i always order their chicken shish kabob entree , which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables .   the chicken is always tender , well - marinated , and equally well - seasoned .   their beef shish kabob entree is also very good . try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor , or just enjoy it as is .   it 's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes , but their hummus is always creamy and smooth , and i love their shirazi salad .   their spicy beans dish , however , is , by far , my personal favorite , and i always make sure to order it .   just as important as the food is the friendly service i encounter whenever i visit .   the couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome .   good food and service that makes you feel at home , what more can you ask for ?   simply put , tasty kabob is one of the best ."

4,"i can not speak for the food , ( though the menu looked unique and tantalizing ) , but the beer selection was great , as was service . we arrived on saturday night , the first weekend angels trumpet was open , around 10 p.m. for drinks . there was a large group of us , 9 people ... though there were n't any tables to accomodate our party we were able to stand / be seated comfortably around one of the high - tops . 

 this place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer . the selection can not be beat in downtown phoenix -- 31 craft brews on tap of every taste and style ... and they 're always rotating . i had the biere blonde & white ... 4.5 % alcohol , light , sunny taste . reminded me of four peak 's sunbrew . 

 the selection ranges from hoppy ipas at 10 % alcohol / volume to the lighter , summer brews and everything in between . there is literally something for everyone , even a few wines on tap for the non - beer drinkers . 

 our server was very nice and accommodating .. and though the place was packed she got us our drinks pretty quickly . 

 a couple reasons i did n't give angels trumpet the perfect ' 5 ' star rating : 

 disorganization-- seating was sort of a nightmare ... and we kind of waited around for one of the high - tops to open up and just snagged it . 
 ambience-- i enjoyed the nice , open floor plan but the restaurant - style and dozens of tables / chairs was a bit puzzling considering the kitchen was closed when we arrived . i could n't hear any music above the conversations in the room and the huge , 60 "" tv screens were n't turned on . it 'd be nice for weekend nights to boast something a little more special . if you 're going to close the kitchen , allow people to walk around and mingle more . 

 overall , if you 're looking for a nice place to kick back with a small group of friends and try some awesome , unique beers on tap , angels trumpet is it . their prices are reasonable for the quality offered . have n't tried the food , but the menu is pretty diverse offering a spin on traditional bar food like flatbread pizzas and sandwiches ."
3,"some family were in town and are blackhawks fanatics desperate to watch the game .   this was the only place in the east valley that we could find had the nhl center ice package ( though the girl who answered the phone had to ask somebody else ( "" what 's nhl ? "" ) ) .   not only were they kind enough to put the game on , they put it on a flat screen in the corner of the patio and we were able to have the sound on .   he shoots , he scores !  

 the shepherds pie was good , the beer was cold , and the waitress was very attentive . 

 i 'll stick with ck 's or the baseline pub for the nfl games though .   while rt 's had plenty of tv 's , most of them were small old tube tv 's .   my uncle asked why they were n't showing the score of a basketball game , and i told him it 's just being cut off by the old tv 's screen"
3,"i took my family here using a groupon and it was just ok .   we tried to go on monday however we arrived at 4:30 and the employee working the counter informed us that league play was going to begin at 5:30 so our hour would be cut short .   i was a little irritated with her "" um , yeah sorrry "" but whatever .   we opted to come back the next day to get our full hour .   when we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly gentlemen who provided us our shows and assigned our lane .   we were one of 3 groups in the alley and they placed us side by side instead of giving us a little space .   my wife asked for a glass of water that never came .   so the bowling was fun .   the service was marginal at best .   the lane assignment was awful .   since we only paid $ 15 for 4 people for the hour including shoe rental i will go back again for the same deal .   i would never go there paying full price which is outrageous ."
2,"i have to admit the quality of food here is better than your average berto 's restaurant , however the girl who works the drive - through during the late shift makes some of the strangest mistakes with the food . warning if your ordering 2 items do n't be surprised to find them in one box combined into some strange hybrid . i honestly do n't think she understands the word "" and "" . this has happened to me several times int the last month . always make sure to check your order here ."
5,"what a great surprise stumbling across this bank !   open 7 days a week with lobby service 

 i have banked with the mega uber banks and have been nickeled and dimed ( literally ) with service fees . 

 i opened both a savings and checking account here .   since my company does not offer direct deposit the associate told me i would have to have a traditional checking account with service fees .   i 'm thinking - here we go again .   but it was one of those think on your feet moments .   off they went ( i 'll assume to get approval ) .    they let me open up a type of checking account that only charges you for check printing - no other fees and pays interest .   in fact , if you use a non - midfirst bank atm , they will refund you the service fees .   how refreshing with the current state of banking ."
5,"visiting a friend who insisted we come to carolina 's on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito to die for . 

 she was totally spot - on . 

 these delicious hand - made tortillas are fantastic !   i wish i could take a bunch back to seattle with me , but since they 're freshly - made , i 'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality . 

 i enjoyed the chorizo , egg , and potato burrito with plenty of salsa .   i loved the spicy / smooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito . 

 i hope i get a chance to eat here again before leaving town !"
5,"i 've been going here for 10 years . my relationship began when i needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to europe . i needed everything quickly and was very specific . she got everything done in time for my trip . 

 over the years i 've brought dozens of clothes . she 's done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress . she 's hemmed and taken in . she 's shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look . i can communicate anything i want and she 'll have it done exactly the way i envisioned it . we 've been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks . 

 her prices are a little high but well worth the quality . every single person i 've recommended has been extremely pleased with her work ."
5,always a marvelous experience . the patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting . the menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff . the cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines . the food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here . i have been there for valentine 's day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special . it is pricey but worth every penny you pay .
5,"i just stopped in tonight after the gym , i was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap . 

 it was late 8:15 when i walked in : 15 before close . this is a great time to shop when you are in a rush . it was empty , and the lines were short . 

 despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me ."
2,i do n't know how this place stays in business . the menu is so limited . would you like chicken or chicken ? chicken in a pita ? chicken on some lettuce ? chicken rolled in a tortilla ? and the pita chips are bland ! yuck ! and   the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy . i 've only been twice and tried different dishes both times but i just do n't get anything greek about this place .
4,"the food and cocktails at this place are amazing - beyond comparison . i have not eaten one bad thing off of their menu . i am not a margarita person at all but my friend insisted i try their primarita ( essentially a skinny margarita ) and it was amazing . probably what all margaritas are supposed to taste like . i crave them . 

 their guacamole is phenomenal - fresh and made right in front of you to your taste . you really ca n't get any better without going to mexico and eating at at a mom and pop restaurant . the pork shoulder is great and the skirt steak is to die for . this is also a great brunch spot - the green chile chilaquiles are outstanding . 

 they are on the pricey end but their entrees are shareable . i love the dark , candlelit ambience . perfect for pretty much any occasion : date night or bachelorette party . 

 cautions : it seems next to impossible to get a weekend dinner reservation between 6 pm and 9:30pm . i do n't know if these are blocked out by default on open table . your best bet is to make your reservation well in advance and call them directly . i have never been to this place as a walk - in for dinner . service has also been hit or miss . i seem to get an excellent server or a really bad one ."
5,"unfortunately , my birthday always falls right around mother 's day .   which means that every time i want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed .   we thought we 'd celebrate early by going on saturday , but it was still packed .   we called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 pm , but the person on the phone said that if we just came down , they would fit us in . 

 so we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes ( in your face chain restaurants ! ! ! ) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami .   these people think of everything . and the wait staff is pretty damn attentive .   the hostess heard me say something about my birthday , which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing .  

 the bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me , but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip , which was soooo tasty .   my steak was soft but cooked exactly how i like it .   these are true professionals .   asparagus was cooked perfectly .   the chicken pot pie soup was exactly what i expected and so yummy .   and the dessert ?   triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian , chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich , and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if i was a normal rasberry eating human . 

 yes , it 's a little pricey , but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish .   especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal .   the atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded .   if you are wierd about personal space , this is probably not the place to go . 

 overall : i love this place and go every time i get the opportunity ."
5,"we were here on wednesday , 12/21/11 . we had been at a rubios in ca recently and was extremely disappointed . not this time ! 

 jacob was our order taker and was very courteous and professional . 

 my husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie . i went with the grilled veggie burrito and man , it was huge and tasty ! 

 this is what rubios is about !"
4,great food !   the fez burger is a real winner .   the staff and clientele are friendly .   great place to meet people for drinks and hang out .
5,amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings .   wine and booze selections are great too .   killer store like candyland for adults .   prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something .   great place !
2,"i went to arriba last night with my wife and another couple .   i have been to this location a handful of times and always had the same result .   the food was okay but the main problem here is the super slow service . 

 it took us nearly two hours to eat dinner here .   it took forever to get our chips and salsa .   it took us nearly as long to get our drinks .   forget about refills .     when our food finally arrived we asked for an additional plate but never got it .   i asked for a water when our food came out and got it after i was 3/4 done with my meal ... and i do not eat fast .   our waiter was friendly but hardly ever checked in with us .   when we asked for the check he said he would bring it in five minutes .   his five minute deadline was not met . 

 i do n't think i will be eating here again .   i have given them too many chances ."
5,"i have been frequenting this spot since they opened and have always said they were better than starbucks but iam in a special kind of heaven after the change in menu and addition of pressed tea lattes ! ! ! yum , yum , yum ! ! ! far better than starbucks powdered green tea latte and roughly a dollar cheaper than the high priced cup there as well . the early morning staff is great and free wifi is an added bonus . i can honestly say for the new year , i 'm quitting you starbucks ...... and mean it ."
2,"being a phoenix native , i almost felt embarassed that i only ate at pete 's for the first time seven years ago . 
 i had gotten back from england and was trying to recreate the orgasmic fish and chips experience i had there . pete 's was around the corner from my complex and after all , i did see so many   of those "" i 'm addicted to pete 's fish & chips "" bumper stickers all around tempe . i had to try it . 

 i ordered the two fish combo , and my reaction was ... what the .. ? .. are they serious ? 

 1 . ) the "" chips "" suuuuck . no salt , overcooked and stiff . i could n't even eat them . 
 2 ) the two squares of fish i got were alright , but i may as well have gone to safeway and bought a box of gorton 's fish sticks . 
 3 . ) the red "" special sauce "" .   wtf ? and you have to pay extra if you want tarter ? lame . 
 4 . ) no malt vinegar . enough said . 

 why there is such a collective hard - on for this place is beyond me . it 's a laughably bad example of fish and chips ."
4,"this place made me feel comfortable about moving to arizona .   i just moved from l.a. and was totally worried about not having access to asian stuff .   of course it is not comparable to l.a. but this place has all the essentials . 

 * vegetables = fresh 
 * meat = frozen 
 * fish = frozen 
 * dried food = plenty 
 * bread = they bring in baked goods from olive bakery in l.a. 
 * cooking supplies = half of the store is full of them"
1,"great donuts but horrible service ... did n't get anything we wanted due to a language barrier between us and the limited english speaking employee . she claimed , in broken english , to only speak spanish . she understood only the word "" dozen "" and we got a dozen of what ever she felt like giving us , then proceeded to ignore us while using her cell phone ! 
 donut shops are a dime a dozen and we will never again return to bosa ."
4,love it ! food & service always great !
1,"so far my restaurant experience in phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake . everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something . finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious , i ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit . however once again the food was dropped off with no silverware , no condiments and no refills on the coffee . i truly hope the restaurant re - trains the staff or hires a whole new batch , because i am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat ."
4,"i go here for the free wifi and the bleu cheese crumble salad . that 's it . bleu cheese , craisins , sunflower seeds all on a bed of romaine . love it . i do n't think i 've ever had anything else on the menu , now that i think about it . free wifi will get me in every time , that 's for sure ! i chose this location because i was in phoenix in - between activities , and did n't want to drive back to gilbert . this was at the biltmore , and yeah , you knew you were in a paradise bakery at the biltmore . kind of funny actually . what can i say ? i like to people - watch . :-)"
5,loved it ! best french toast ever !
3,"sometimes you just want to give an a for effort ... 

 or maybe more than three lame stars .   as the two other previous reviewers have pointed out succinctly , the man who i assume to be the owner was extremely nice .   i made the 1.5 hour drive from tucson to watch avatar at arizona mills , and my friends and i decided to grab a bite before heading back .   we randomly drove down baseline and pretty much stumbled upon this place .   traffic going westbound towards the 10 was insane .   i mean it was bumper to bumper past rural .   anyway , i ask the guy who i assume is the owner why the traffic was so bad .   at first he did n't know , but then realized that the 60 was closed .   he politely recommended that we head south then cut across to get back to the 10 .  

 i ordered the jerusalem falafel sandwich . it was pretty good .   though , in all honesty , falafel is not one those kind of dishes that one can gush over .   in my opinion , it 's pretty hard to mess up deep frying ground chickpeas .   i ought to point out that the ingredients were very fresh .   this also applied to the side salad that comes with the combo meal .   my two friends opted for the gyros , and it looked good .   the meat was thinly sliced , which is somewhat different than others i 've had .   they seemed to enjoy the meal , but i do n't think they were quite overwhelmed by it either .   in fact , we did n't mention anything about the food during the hour and a half trip back home .  

 the food is by no means bad at pita shack .   it 's adequate to serviceable in terms of mediterranean food .   the positives regarding the food have to be its freshness and price .   in fact , i spent no more than $ 8 for a sandwich , salad , and drink .   the service , as noted previously , is undoubtedly the most shining spot of the place .    as we were finishing up our meal , the guy who i assume is the owner offered us lentil soup on the house .   we declined after being quite filled and satisfied from our respective sandwiches .   i believe another reviewer had the same thing happen to him , and he had positive comments about it .   now , for me it 's was the food that really matters .   accordingly , i gave three stars , as opposed to the four that i was close to giving .   should i ever return to the tempe area hankering for food in a pita , i would most definitely give pita shack another shot ; if only to support a genuinely nice guy 's business ."
5,"let me tell you about my first crush in phoenix . it happened to me when i least expected . i was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job . birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different . when i walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker , i noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes . a white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork . one bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and i was in lust . it later turned into love and i 've been happy every since . 

 i silently thank the coworker who introduced me to honey moon sweets because i ca n't imagine life without knowing about this sweet phoenix treat . over the years , honey moon sweets has been my go - to bakery for a special occasion . i 've purchased the "" basic "" cake for birthday parties . let me just note here that a basic cake from honey moon sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery 's mind . when planning my sister 's baby shower , i knew exactly where to go . i wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table . and behold the honey moon sweets baby cake . it was three tiers , blue with rattles , pacifier , building blocks , a crib , a teddy bear ... you name it filling the top . some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys . it was almost too gorgeous to eat , but we could n't resist it so enjoyed every bite . it was just as good as it looked if not better . honey moon sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite . the scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the biltmore for the baby shower . one wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand . as you can imagine , cakes from honey moon sweets are not budget - friendly , but for what you get from the cake , it 's reasonably priced . just save your coins for a special occasion because it 's worth it . i promise ."
5,"i 'm sure most people do n't go to a fancy steak restaurant for the mac ' n cheese , but as a mac aficionado , it 's practically my duty . and the mac here , well it 's high quality . i like to order the lobster mac sans lobster ( not a big fan of seafood ) , which without the seafood , is actually quite inexpensive . now be warned , this is real heavy mac ' n cheese . it 's so cheesy , and thick , and delicious ; do n't plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it ."
4,"right down the street from four peaks , this liquor store rests in an unassuming strip mall . nothing notable or special about the outside . you would have no idea that there is such a wonderful beer selection inside . 

 the inside has about 1/3 of the store devoted to individual ( mostly ) bomber bottles of beer first organized by country and in the case of the us by state . a wide variety of several hundred varieties . the staff was helpful and knowledgable about their inventory and quizzed me about the beers i was buying at the register . ok i was a little annoyed about the quiz but at least they knew what they were talking about . the place has several beers in coolers along the walls as well . 

 the prices were reasonable and probably a little cheaper than other regional stores . i would recommend this little diamond in the rough for people in tempe looking to bulk up their drinking resumes ."
4,"i have to laugh at the person that stated the service was bad . i have now been three times ( can you blame a gal for craving a burger ? ) and each time everyone is almost too overfriendly . they ask if you have been in before and if you state no , they offer to go over the menu . now this might stop after this location has been open longer , but it 's helpful since there are only a few locations in the valley . when your order is ready , you are paged and you go up to grab your meal , and they always find it necessary to read back your order , when right in your hand is a tray with a juicy burger begging you to take a bite ... so i am always a little feisty for them to read it off , since i want to chow down ! they also seem to want to check in on you while you are eating , which is nice ... but can be overwhelming if you are on your lunch break and trying to catch up with a friend ... but i wo n't complain about good ol' polite customer service . 

 i order their original char burger without cheese and without the onions ( i did try them with the onions and honestly , i liked the taste of the burger better without ) 

 i like their crispy onion rings , they seem healthy if that is even possible for an onion ring ... but they are crispy and not greasy . try them , you 'll understand what i am saying better :) 

 the fun item i always get "" to go "" ? ? ? their coffee flavored milk shake . it 's light , it has nice flavor and is a little bit of heaven . 

 ps : parking is not like it was with "" my florist "" there are many more available spaces now , which is totally awesome ."
4,i only go to ihop for pancakes because i do n't really like anything else on the menu . ordered chocolate chip pancakes and a hot chocolate . everything was great and i left full and satisfied ! !
4,thanks to all of you yelpers for recommending this place ! it was just what i have been looking for in my neighborhood- fresh and tasty chinese food for a decent price unspoiled by trendiness . thanks ! i will definitely add deserg jade to my regular rotation .
5,"this is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right . i always get the jerk chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it . good flavor , lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious . i personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great . there 's alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware !"
5,"for some reason these self serve frozen yogurt places have popped up all over the valley and they are all very similar . what i like about this place are the choices . i usually do n't have any issues , i 'm a mint chocolate chip man , and that 's typically what i order . my girlfriend on the other hand likes to mix it up and try new flavors and toppings . this place has the largest selection of flavors and toppings of any of the self served frozen yogurt places we 've been too . for those of you who are calorie conscience , as i am , they post the nutrition facts right buy the flavor so you know exactly what you 're getting ."
5,"the obsession started about 2 yrs ago and i have n't looked back since ... 
 started with getting them catered for lunch , then a trip here or there to the restaurant . so . good . the bread is amazing , but the love , sweat , tears and what ever else they pop in there is addicting . hmmm , now i am wondering what it is they put in there ? ? anyway , i wo n't think too long and hard about that one . but tomorrow i 'm definitely heading back for the vermonter , got ta feed the addiction ."
4,"so much better that 5 dorks , i mean guys .   they have salads and great chicken selections !"
5,"delicious food and excellent staff make this small french restaurant worthy of five stars . we began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought ( it is byob ) and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer . the taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese , buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal . i ordered the marinated chicken . this dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce , mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach . the flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite , time and time again . my girlfriend got the filet , which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes . for dessert we ordered the tart of the day , which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread - tasting tart . just delicious . the service was wonderful , very efficient and friendly . it is not cheap , it was $ 99 for the appetizer , two entrees and dessert ... but for the experience and the exquisite flavors , i will go back for any special occasion ... guaranteed ."
4,nice little find for casual sushi
4,"the food here was great ! wish there was more indoor seating , but the seating both indoor and outside is nice , live music sometimes , nice decor .   i 've tried a few of the specialty drinks , some are good some are so / so but is n't it always that way ? just preferences .   the prices are a bit high , but the portions are worth it , we can split a meal typically .   the deserts are awesome too !"
4,"a very tasty place for breakfast .   i strenuously object to any place that does n't serve hash browns , but really that 's my only complaint .   they have a ton of different omelets / scrambles ( you choose ) and you can make your own .   example : spinach tomato sausage bacon with american cheese .   as a scramble .   with salsa .   the coffee is good ( i hear from my wife ) and the cinnamon roll is a real treat .   not the best cinnamon roll ever in a million years but a good 8.5/10 .  

 it is true that there can be a very long wait so plan ahead for sure .   you 'll be waiting outside .  

 they grill their wheat toast - solid ."
5,"this store made me feel like i had died and went to fabric heaven .   there is just so much beautiful , wonderful , amazing fabric .   i dropped a pretty penny- but i 've already used some of my perfect fabric for great projects . 

 the place is clean , the staff is super friendly and patient- especially with newbies like me .   when i brought 10 different reams of fabric up and had to stop and really think about how much i needed- patience came with a smile .   it seems like everything ( even the high end designers ) are around $ 10/yard . 

 if you get bogged down with all the fabric that you are falling in love with , they have a cute little table set up with these funny little signs that say "" get your paws off my fabric "" which made me chuckle .   maybe i 'm turning into an old lady who loves silly stuff like that . 

 despite the somewhat sketchy location , 35th ave . sew and vac is my new go - to for fabric !"
4,"this place was awesome ! ! !   my wife and i have been driving by this location for a couple years and finally decided to go in , i had a yearning for ramen .   it did not disappoint .   we got there just before happy hour , which is always a bonus , but would still go outside of happy hour .   the menu is quite extensive , the bonus is they have italian noodle dishes as well .   we have been told that this is authentic to japan so i was impressed to see this in the valley , having been to many "" japanese "" restaurants . 

 we decided to try many different dishes , and were equally impressed with all .   i had the tantan - men , a spicy ramen with pork , delicious .   we shared some tuna sashimi , which was fresh and tasty ( looked like real pink , no added color ) .   we also shared the seafood delight roll , which has tuna , ' krab ' and is topped with a scallop , fantastic .   the last thing we ordered were the spicy korean ribs , this was my least favorite , but still good .   of course the kirin ( on draft ) was flowing as well as the house saki . 

 overall the cherryblossom noodle cafe impressed us to say the least .   we will be back to try more .   thank you cherryblossom , keep up the great work ."
4,i do not eat fast food .   i do eat at in - n - out .   mmmm double double animal style
4,"pei wei is a family favorite , especially for take out . i can call pei wei while i leave the house , order my food as i drive , and when i arrive 9 times out of 10 the food is hot and ready to roll . the food is always tasty and at a fair price . we love it ."
4,"southern hospitality ? yes ma'am ( or mister )   :) 

 the first thing that struck me was that my server had a lovely accent . 
 my daughter looked at me & asked me if it was part of her job to fake an accent , , , , i went with no . i 'm not sure where it 's from , but it 's a ' honey & y' all ' accent :d she had a very friendly disposition & made our lunch experience a pleasure . she made her mama proud . 

 the food was decent and you can have breakfast all day . i love having breakfast for dinner , so that 's a big selling point to me :) 

 the building is fairly new , not too brightly lit & clean . 

 in all honesty i would have given them an a ok rating , 3 stars , but our server pushed them to a ' yay ! i 'm a fan ' , 4 star rating . 
 good people make the difference !"
5,"love this place !   their slices are delicious ( and huge ) and a great deal .   service is always fast and good .   their loyalty programs ( frequent visits and vip card ) are also great .    the fact that they 're locally owned and support the local community does n't hurt either .   :) 

 it 's basically the only place i go to for pizza nowadays .   1 slice is more than enough , and i love that i can get it just the way that i want .   if you 're a member of their vip program ( free to join ) you can also get the slices for dinner too ."
2,"i read the two good reviews here on yelp , so i was looking forward to a good italian dinner .   unfortunately , it must have been an off night .   the waitress did n't want to be bothered and the meatballs and the tomato sauce on the spaghetti did n't have much flavor .   that 's the test of a good italian restaurant for me .   if the sauce is good , they usually get thumbs up .   this sauce was n't "" bad , "" but it was bland and watery .   even the bowl of spaghetti was n't drained properly so there was a dripping , runny mess at the bottom of the paltry bowl of pasta .   this place is right around the corner from my house and dominic is my brother 's name !   so i was really disappointed ."
3,"good , fresh chinese food , a little pricey . 

 there are two types of chinese food . cheap , greasy , satisfying chinese food in a questionable joint . and upscale atmospheric chinese food that aspires to captivate the same audiences that enjoy places like p.f chengs . this would be the latter : an awhatukee hole in the wall version of p.f chengs . very clean restaurant , nice atmosphere , and good service . you can tell their motif is such that they cater to the tukee types with a little more coin in hand : /. this is the kind of place you 'll find a lot of older families , or much older groups of friends dining together in . 

 both the orange chicken , and the almond chicken were good , and were made barring on the side of caution when it comes to grease . they were big portions ( for $ 8) , with big fresh peices of white meat , fresh vegetables , and no msg . there is no chance of this meal offending a pickier type with grease , textures , or flavors ( which makes it less interesting in my opinion ) . 

 both dishes were good , but nothing amazing from the 2 dishes i tried . 

 the green tea ice cream was good , but i 've had better green tea ice cream :/ . their version was a little too heavy with cream , and could have used some fruit , or something creative to go with the ice cream . 

 the only other dessert option was another flavor of ice cream . 

 the service was great , very polite and friendly waiters ."
5,"wife and i had the large burgers . many options as to toppings , whole grain bun is also an option . store is spotless and staff is young and cheerful . i had sw style w / guacamole and jalapeno , spouse chose classic american cheeseburger . we ordered sweet potato fries to split . they are awesome and the single portion was large enough for 2 1/2 people . we were advised ( in advance ) that burgers would be pink inside , which we prefer . if you want yours well done , ask . you order at counter , and the food is brought to your booth . this was our second visit , and we would return . store is nnear movies in food are of tempe marketplace , so expect to spend some time looking for a spot ."
4,"there really is n't a better time to go to sapporo than right now to enjoy their every day summer happy hour for cheap , good quality food & drinks . there are great discounts on beer , wine , and cocktails including the awesome mango martini , and several very popular appetizers , rolls , and sushi .   i adore the chicken skewers and sliders , but my favorite are the diver scallops .   i do n't think they are on the happy hour menu but they rock ! 

 teppanyaki here is also very fun for a group and the n scottsdale crowd is great for people watching .   whether for a date or girls / guys night out , sapporo 's energetic vibe has a lot of fun to offer ."
4,"let me qualify my review by stating that i have not been to butter & me .   i have had their yummy mini cupcakes at a yelp event . 

 i tried the red velvet mini cupcake .   it was really good .   moist and flavorful with a rich creamy frosting .   yum .   i chased it with few sips of cruz tequila .   hey , it was in my other hand . 

 i also tried a chocolate mini cupcake .   yummy .   again , moist and delicious .   i do n't know how they keep the mini ones from drying out .   when i make mini muffins at home they dry out easily ( that is if any survive the first half hour ... the survival rate for any kind of pastry in my vicinity is exceedingly low ) . 

 i also garnered a few extra cupcakes to take back to my wife and a friend and score points .   mini cupcakes = brownie points ."
4,tacos and enchilada today . good flavor & fresh salsa . fast service and very friendly staff today ( even though they were understaffed ) . you will enjoy rudys lf you have never been .   authentic az mexican food .
4,"this is a new neighborhood breakfast joint in a building many think is "" cursed "" .   the turnover for businesses at this location is high .   but i think oink is going to make it !   they were very busy when we were there so it took a little bit to get refills on coffee ( need bigger cups ) and the food took a couple minutes longer , but no worries .   who i think is the owner was not just standing by and watching everyone else run around like chickens with their heads cut off , they were serving , clearing plates , filling coffee .   love to see that !  

 the menu is decent .   i 'm not a huge breakfast person but there were quite a few items on the menu i was interested in .   the funny thing is my hubby and i ended up not ordering any bacon and did n't realize this until after we finished eating !   so we definitely will be going back to try the bacon they are known for .... jalapeno bacon anyone !"
4,"this place is great . the pizzas are single serving or post salad and some of the best pizza i ve ever had . salads are good and and service is excellent . 

 keep it simple stupid 
 kiss"
4,"if you work in an office and have to dress business casual , ny & co is your place to shop . some of their stuff can be a bit plain but more often then not , they have modest , cute , stylish , business casual clothes at an affordable price . i do n't think i have ever been bugged by a salesperson when coming to this store which is actually kinda nice . i ca n't stand salespeople following me around chiming in about how cute something is ( see my review on coach in lv ) . lastly , they have a great display of accent jewelry which is my weakness . everything is always really different and fun so i ca n't resist and usually walk out with several pieces . the next time you are trying to find a place to shop , try ny & co. there is something for everybody    :)"
5,"awesome awesome awesome ! ! ! our table all ordered a 5 course tasting   and it was amazing ! ! the flavors pop in your mouth ! ! very creative chef . i do n't think there was one course we were disappointed in . by the end of the 3 hour dinner we had a total of 21 courses . each one full of flavor making you want more . the staff was excellent , always there when you need them but not hovering . i would definitely go again . pricey but so worth it ! !"
3,"came to blanco tacos during restaurant week 2009 . the guacamole they served with the chips was so yummy ! the flan was also delicious . i will come back just to eat the flan ! 

 the scene was pretty cool . fun people watching environment ."
5,"steve is one of the few shops that can still do a decent flat top .   he is in my neighborhood , so it is great for me - convenient .    steve is personable and the shop is inviting .   i love the hot towel and back - vibrator massage .   i have been going to steve for years , great service product !"
5,"that 's amore is awesome ! i 'm glad to see that a nice , clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized . it deserves the five star ratings- the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor . it 's a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot ."
3,"the food is decent and fairly cheap . the only complaints i have about it is the place is pretty small and can get crowded , they do n't serve liquor ( eh , but there is a liquor store next door , so i can eat and then get a beer , but sometimes it 's nice to have a margarita with your burro ) and not always , but sometimes one particular lady that works there can be kind of rude and can mess up your order . 
 though i do enjoy their food and it 's within walking distance of my residence ."
5,"absolutely incredible . it appears the young lad who works here seems to be the go - to front - desk man everyday for this shop . he was very helpful and told me exactly what my shoes needed and did n't suggest pricier repair options that my shoes really were n't in need of ! i brought in two pairs of dress shoes ; one of which i had the heels replaced ( $ 22 , free shining included ) and another just for shining ( $ 8 ) and they made them look near - brand new again ! i will certainly be bringing all of my shoes in for repairs / cleaning within the near future to this fantastic little shop !

5,"i 'm a regular at lux . have n't reviewed it out of sheer laziness . and it 's usually laziness that brings me here : when i have a major thingie to get done by day b but i spent all of day a at the office surfing the internet instead of working on it , i pay the price with an all - nighter , which i like to start at lux . ( damn them for not being open past 10 ) . this is usually the story when anyone spots me here . 

 i 'll grab a small table for myself , plug in my laptop ( free wifi ) , spread out my papers everywhere , then go up to the counter for a large and extremely delicious velvet latte . when it 's done right , there 's a perfect swirl of white cream that forms the shape of a leaf on the surface of the caramel - colored coffee . mmm . 

 since i am add i take frequent breaks of course . like every 3 minutes . whenever i hear a strange piece of music i really like that i 've never heard before ( this happens often ) , i strain to catch part of the lyrics , stick it into google , find the name of the band , stick it into itunes and download it . i 'm not making that up . like half my music collection was created through this method . the last few bands i downloaded tracks from are ... let me open up my itunes ... kasabian , feist , and the detroit cobras . i 'm not even remotely hip enough to have heard of those before on my own ."
4,"had a wonderful experience here from first drink to last bite . atmosphere has a nice chic upscale feel to it and the lighting is nice and cozy . we waited in the nice bar while we waited for our table . the orange martini they have is just heaven . after a few of those down the hatch i tried a "" keg "" size glass of wine and was great as well . 

 this is def a steak joint , so about 90 % is all about steaks but there are some salads , fish and crab options . ( they are also having a lobster special right now ) . lover had the prime rib and crab combo and loved it ( they are apparently really known for their prime rib ) i went with the crab off course and did not disappoint . 

 the staff was very nice and very patient and i noticed that just about everyone that works here is good looking also . just a pretty place filled with pretty people and good food !"
5,i am for out of town and came here to celebrate my birthday and it was a blast . the food was delicious and our tepenyaki chef robert was hilarious and very on point . this place is definitely a must when going to scottsdale . i do go to arizona a lot and will definitely be back soon .
5,"yes , it is probably as good as it gets for a sandwich place . very tasty . all 3 of us liked our different sandwiches . i also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good , but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad . real good besides that ."
4,"my family was on the west side of town yesterday and since we do n't know that area quite as well we wanted to try a restaurant that had a track record , as we did n't want to take a chance on a local - owned shop . 

 i certainly was n't disappointed . the restaurant is clean , as were the restrooms , and i loved the island theme - it give the place a coastal feel , which is nice if you live in arizona ! 

 i had some kind   of combo burrito that was good sized and gulped down every bite . i was in the restroom when my wife ordered for me , so could n't comment on the friendliness of the staff ."
5,"i think my fellow oreganymphos would agree ; this is single handedly one of the greatest places on earth to gorge yourself with some of the most delicious pizza , pastas and desserts az has to offer . 

 if you wanna take my word for it , do nt even look at the menu and order my usual orgasmic order : 

 appetizer : calimari 
 dinner : big rig pasta w/ chicken 
 dessert : white chocolate chip macadamian nut pazookie 

 fyi : whenever your taste buds feel like going on a culinary roadtrip , make sure you hit up any of the various oregano 's locations located around the state ; my personal favs are the flagstaff and tucson locations ."
4,"dear weather & coffee , 

 i 'm really sorry you had to close .   we had a lot of good times together .   every time i came in , you always seemed really happy to see me ... even though you knew me by the wrong name .  

 i may be kelly to everyone else , but i 'll always be aubrey to you ."
1,"let me first say if i could have given 0 stars i would have . 

 my wife and i went to this place and were extremely disappointed . we had gone to a different pancho 's many years ago and were hoping it would be like that . the choices were very very limited and basic . there are so many amazing mexican dishes yet my only choices were a tamale , taco and some horrible tasting enchiladas . how does a mexican food place not offer burritos ... have you guys heard of a bean burrito ? its pretty popular and would be a good choice to offer . 

 the only food here that is worth eating is the baby churros and the sopapillas , which actually were good . unfortunately i did n't go to this place to pay $ 20 so my wife and i can eat sopapillas . 

 please listen to my advice when i tell you to avoid this place . take your money to taco bell and get a lot better mexican food at a fraction of the cost ."
4,"seriously , their happy hour prices ca n't be beat .   a beer , a spicy tuna roll , calamari and avocado egg roll for under $ 20 including tip .   service was attentive and friendly .   we had to lurk around the bar area for awhile to get a table , but that only speaks to how popular this place is .   if you are looking for an inexpensive dinner out that does n't involve denny 's or olive garden this is a great choice ."
4,"my wife and i went here and sat on the patio near the canal . the temperature was perfect for being outside and the view of camelback was sublime . my only complaint about the seating was it was difficult to read our menus when we were there in the evening . 
 our waiter was friendly and helpful . 
 the chicken salad sandwich i had was very good and my wife loved the burger she ordered . 
 all in all a very nice and relaxing sunday evening dinner ."
5,i love this store !   they have an amazing staff and the most modern clothes !   i set my appointments with a few of the employees and i always get compliments on my outfits when i go out ! !   hats off to the ted baker team in scottsdale fashion square !
3,"i 'd read about this place before ( on blogs written by people from utah ) so when i was driving down baseline and hungry and saw it i decided to try it out . 

 it is set up a lot like chipotle , however the process of ordering is somehow not quite as clear . additionally i was n't sure what went with my meal and what cost extra . 

 that aside the salmon tacos i got were really tasty . i do n't think i 've had salmon as the fish in fish tacos at a restaurant before and i enjoyed the change . 

 the price seemed a little high , but not so high that i wo n't visit again if i 'm in gilbert and looking for a quick meal ."
5,"got to love the concept , coffee , art and a co - work space friendly for start - ups .   osp has that feel of old college dorm meets painters loft .   the coffee is good , the wifi is fast and the staff is friendly and they do n't harass you , i could n't ask for more to get work done !"
5,"i came here on the opening night when someone from gin blossoms played on a makeshift stage , the beers were 25 cents and there was no food ( but you know me , we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place . ) since then , they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing ( chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempura - like batter and are over the age of four ) , the beer is astounding ( one word : kolsch ... makes me swoon ) and the people are great . it 's worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to park -- even better , ride your bike over like we do ! the sunday brunch is great . all of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily . i do n't blame them ."
4,"this is one the best venues in phoenix in my opinion for live music . wonderfully low - lit , divey atmopshere , great drink prices and down - to - earth crowd with no pretense or attitude . the bouncer / doorman was all pimped out and welcomed me with a handshake . this is really a great alternative from hitting a bar or a club . a true gem in the valley . only downside is parking . the neighbors do n't like it if you park in front of their house - my friend was yelled at by one of them . and they "" punished "" me by positioning their trash cans in front of and in back of my car .   if said neighbor is reading this review , know this : next time , i 'm going to take out your stupid trash cans . i understand it sucks to have people park in front of your house , but i was not loud , nor did i puke or urinate or your lawn , so chill !"
4,"i do n't know if i should say i love this place or really dislike them .   they are dangerous .   it 's like they know my number .   i was supposed to just passed by and head to another store , but i could n't help it . i saw the shoe sale , they have it every few months now .   tons of shoes for 65 % off .   i guess a girl can not have enough shoes .   hey , my pretty shoes do n't care if i gain or loose a few pounds .   today , i got 3 more pairs . danny helped me out , he has been in the shoe department forever .   i remember him helping me since 2006 at least , wow , that is 6 years now . 
 i love some of the gianni binni dresses , too ( that is the house brand ) .   they are very well made and if you are lucky enough to catch them on one of the big sales you can score a great dress for under $ 80.00"
4,"i 'm a huge fan of grimaldi 's pizza .   the better half and i stopped in here for dinner and we had a huge appetite ..... which is dangerous in a pizza joint for me . 

 i ordered : 
 caprese salad - $ 7 
 personal sized pizza ( $ 9 ) with : 
 sundried tomatoes - $ 4 
 red peppers - $ 4 
 ricotta cheese - $ 2 
 mushrooms - $ 2 
 jalapenos - $ 2 
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdvwccu463u3lm7lha?select=dz7xu0lf2iig2_di1c_cra 

 the better half ordered a personal sized pizza ( $ 9 ) with : 
 pepperoni - $ 2 
 mushrooms - $ 2 
 feta cheese - $ 2 
 basil - $ 2 
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdvwccu463u3lm7lha?select=1paote8ys9ujup3u4djhiq 

 yeah , all toppings are al la carte here .... so it 's not cheap .   the pizza was awesome !   i enjoyed every bite .   the combination of the sweet taste of sun dried tomatoes combined with the spicy kick of jalapenos mixed in with ricotta , mushrooms , and red peppers hit the spot ! 
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdvwccu463u3lm7lha?select=l4mzat7mxpslp4lqexfy5g 

 the better half enjoyed her pizza too .   since i 'm on my no meat diet , i took her word for it .... as much as i was tempted to give it a try , i resisted .... maybe next time . 

 to wash it down , she had 2 glasses of brazin zinfandel $ 8 ea , i had 2 o'douls $ 4 ea .   all in , the dinner was $ 72 before tip . 

 overall , it was a nice dinner .   i finished my food , she took home 1/2 of her pizza . 

 return factor - 100 %"
5,we have been back several times since my initial review and the service and food have been consistently excellent for both lunch and dinner . love their green chiles ! ! !
5,"great beer , good atmosphere , non annoying music and great wait staff make this my favorite place to spend an evening ."
4,"this is a great venue other than it being in the middle of nowhere . 

 went to see rockband live ( the cab , plain white t 's , dashboard confessional , and panic at the disco ) . a good lineup for what was pretty much a promotional event . 

 the concert was great , the sound system and acoustics are pretty much perfect . i highly recommend seeing your favorite band play at jobing.com arena !"
4,"let 's make it very clear that this is not a country club , but if you are a golfer like me and play "" slightly "" over par , this is a good course to play . 

 here are the pro 's : 
 -cheap green fees ( summertime , it is only 10 bucks for all you can play , i believe after 3 p.m ..   i 've shown up earlier than that and they still gave me the same price , with a cart .   awesome ) 
 -the staff is pretty cool 
 -you almost never need a tee time , you can show up and they will usually fit you in no problem 
 -no dress code ( a huge plus while playing in the summer ) 
 -a pretty forgiving course , wider fairways 
 -cheap hotdogs in the snack area and they pump the ac pretty cold in the lounge 
 -no doglegs on the course ( i fucking hate those ) 
 -they do n't seem to give a shit when you smuggle your own beer on the course 
 -no punk kid cleaning your clubs 2 seconds after you are done playing so you feel obligated to give him a tip 

 the con 's : 
 -a good portion of the grass is fucked up .   i 've dinged the piss out of my clubs having to hit from the dirt on this course 
 -the greens are in bad shape .   you throw away a lot of shots putting from the "" mud "" or "" dirt ""   i played there once where some asshole carved a pentagram in the green next to the cup .   it always makes me feel better knowing satan is watching how shitty i am playing 
 -no bathroom on the course except for the port - o - shitter half way through the course .   it usually has so much urine on the floor and walls you are better off pissing in the bushes or out of the cart when you are driving it .   i was there one time where someone actually shit on the floor of the fiberglass shit house 
 -there seem to be a lot of homeless people between holes 7 and 8 asking for change and/or beers set up by the dumpster next to the golf course 
 -there are a bunch of cats that run out of the brush in the wash .   i almost hit one with a chip shot the last time i played there . 

 all things considered , this is a good course to play and have fun at .   plus you ca n't beat the price .   just do n't expect judge smails at bushwood estates ."
5,"i love this place . food is always fresh , cook correct and service is great . not to mention their lunch specials ! ! ! my husband and i always spend less than 20 bucks and get full and satisfied everytime ! ! ! !"
5,"i 've been using mineral makeup for a couple years now and bare escentuals is the best in my experience . you can order their stuff online as well and it 's free shipping after a certain amount , but i like being able to ask questions and compare things side by side before i buy , and the salesgirls are always really helpful with that . once i find a product i 'm loyal to , then i do the online thing . this stuff just feels much better on your skin and does n't clog your pores . it seems like an initially pricey investment when you 're first getting started , but mineral make - up keeps much better and i can use less of it to achieve the effects i want ."
1,soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate . carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs . gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy .
4,went to see under the sea in 3d ...... awesome on the big screen and the 3d was fantastic . the staff were helpful and friendly only missing a star because it could use a little upgrade ...... this however does not effect your viewing ..... and there were no annoying advertisments before the show .... so refreshing ! there are two other nature shows playing at the moment ..... african adventure in 3d and dinosaurs alive in 3d. great for the kids too as it is only 40 minutes long .
1,"i called them and they wanted to charge $ 30 for fingerprints ! ! ! ! !   what a joke .   i found a place on the other side of the air park who did it for $ 10 .   caveat emptor !   if if could give them a zero rating , i would have . 

 on the other side of the airpark off of greenway - hayden loop is global pi security .   $ 10 for prints . their address is 7807 east greenway road , suite 9 , scottsdale , az .   globalpi - security ( dot ) com .   good luck ."
4,best basic $ 12 in / exterior wash i got in a while . did nt even have to tell them to wipe down anything .
2,"things that might happen at bikini lounge : 

 you might watch your friends dance with a bum in front of the juke box . 

 you might drink far too many pitchers of pbr . 

 you might throw a fit when you realize it is cash only . 

 the bikini lounge is quite possibly the crappiest place known to man . i mean it 's in a shitty neighborhood where you might die , does n't take credit cards , and has only bags of chips for food . so why do i keep going back ? because eventful things happen here . do n't go if you want to have a quiet night with a couple of friends and go home and go to bed . go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes , order pitchers of pbr until you and your friends are all sick , then go outside and forget where you are and turn left down grand avenue only to find out you are nowhere near home when you get to the burned down church on 5th ave and monroe and a bum asks you for money . after that , you 'll get in a bike taxi / rikshaw and tell the guy you can only pay him in cigarettes and then when he agrees , have him take you to another bar , instead of home , and then you will be further than you were to begin with . when you finally do get home thanks to a caring homeless guy that actually does have money ( you find this out because he has a car ) and gives you a ride home . you wake up the next morning wondering why all of your cash is gone , how much you drank , and where your friends are . 

 if that is the kind of night you are looking for , bikini lounge is it !"
3,"asi - asi , menza - menza , comme ci comme ca ... you get the jist . 

 so -so .. ( a solid so - so ) . 

 he liked the taco 's , i liked the steak salad ( it had a nice little kick to it ) service was good . the atmosphere just was n't my cup of tea , that said , i can see why some people like it here .drinks were solid , menu was decent . 

 good place to get hammered , i suppose . 

 i had a pinneapple mind eraser that was ......"
4,"huge fan of this bistro . everyday or two there is a new exotic meat that you must try . 

 the staff is super awesome and brant is my go to guy . 

 i highly recommend sangria sundays , the wagyu and veggie burger are my absolute favorites . not to mention , the sweet potato fries and purple haze beer . 

 if you like sliders , this is the best place to go in scottsdale ."
4,"the main advice i would give anyone interested in dining at postino arcadia would be : "" prepare to fight . ""   prepare to fight for a parking space and prepare to fight for the bruschetta which is to die for .   my favorites would have to be the smoked salmon and pesto , apple and brie , prosciutto and fig and warm artichoke .   plus , you can not beat a bottle of vino and 4 types of bruschetta for $ 20 every monday and tuesday after 8 pm ! 

 i am also a huge fan of their pretzel pub board and nyc grilled cheese that is companied by a sierra nevada mustard , pesto and ketchup dipping sauces , washed down with a cold stella artois lager belgium .   these menu items have sparked inspiration for me to make similar dishes in my own kitchen more than a time or two .   so grab some good company , a bottle of vino paired with bruschetta and prepare for a relaxing - enjoyable night out . 

 do n't forget the affogato ( vanilla bean ice cream topped with espresso ) to give ya a jolt for your car ride home ."
5,"we went here for my wife 's birthday , and it 's a rare 5-star review for me . they scored on food , presentation , service and atmosphere . we sat indoors - it 's a bit hot out still - and loved the decor , including the fun pillows on our large booth seat . service was prompt , friendly , and attentive - but we never felt rushed . they make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango , lime and rum flavors . the kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared . and after having some disappointing lobster ( in maine of all places ) the maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough . they serve it "" lazy style "" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly . a special birthday souffle topped the evening off . expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion ."
4,"i lived in phx for 7 years and never heard about this place , but having to come back for a friend 's baby shower , i needed to find a good hotel . this place was surprisingly awesome , considering it 's right next to old town . 

 walking up to the rooms part from the outside / back is not very impressive , they kind of look kind of like converted apartments . but inside is contemporary looking , little older , but still nice . the landscaping is awesome . 
 beds are really comfy , the kind you sink into . which is a huge plus for me , since i 'm expecting and my stomach is pretty uncomfortable at the moment . 
 no dated tube tv 's , yay ! we had an lg lcd , and the channel selection was decent , they were all in analog though . 
 i was worried about noise since this is right next to obnoxious old town , but it was really quiet . the only noise we had was a neighbor 's dog deciding to bark at like midnight ... ( they are pet friendly and provide beds , bowls and walks for dogs ) 
 all the rooms have patios so , if it 's not bloody hot it 's nice to sit outside in the morning , listen to the birds , and people watch . 

 our room came with a bucket'o'beer deal as well that we did n't use , esp since i ca n't drink . it was all crappy domestics of the bartender 's choice . 

 the only complaint i have about it was that the pool was packed most of the day .. we went back to the pool around 10:30pm to relax and there was still 5 - 6 children playing in the pool and the spa . what little kids are doing awake and at the pool at like 11 pm , i do n't know . those are some responsible parents ... 

 but for $ 92 a night and all the stuff they include with it , it 's definitely worth it ."
4,i like their chicago dog . it is delicious . i 've had good service here because mostly the owners are almost always working and they are real nice . it 's only when they are gone that you get the crummy service .
5,you want to go to four peaks . trust me .
2,"i like spicy . i mean i like to sweat from the bridge of my nose when i eat . when they asked how hot i wanted my green curry chicken , i did a double take . "" is n't green curry spicy by definition ? "" they told me they make it in varying degrees of spiciness for the asu crowd . while i disagree with diluting the authenticity of the traditional preparation , i get it - they have a business to run . what i really do n't like is how they do it . they make a mild green curry ... er , no , green sauce . then , upon ordering , they add a certain amount of red chili flakes depending on how spicy you want it . this is not only upsetting philosophically , but chili flakes need time to cook in a curry - you do n't just drop in , stir and serve . i get the sense that this problem is rampant in arizona ; hope to find a solution soon ."
5,"i first saw them saturday morning at the phoenix public market and told myself that i would have to try them soon . i was too full from all the sampling with the different vendors . my coworkers and i went to check out the food trucks that gather on thursday outside of whole foods by raintree and the 101 . i saw that mojo bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food . 

 i decided to get the red , white , and kale salad . i love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me . i also wanted to try one of their smoothies out . i went with the coco coca . the description mentioned that it was like a drinkable almond joy and i was sold right there . the total came to $ 13 , not too shabby considering the portions . i did n't even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling , definitely a meal in itself . towards the end of the work day i was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad . i was asked if i wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad . i told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette . the salad was delicious . the kale was chopped up so finely that it really did n't have a taste so if you 're not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad . the portion was huge , it was good for 2 meals . 

 i try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses . mojo bowl definitely brings those two together for me . i ca n't wait to try more of their smoothies and food out soon !"
4,"the decor and ambience was very pleasant .   the staff was very friendly and attentive .    granted , it was a monday night and my wife and i were only one of three parties in the restaurant . 

   we ordered the hot and sour soup , the puu puu platter ( sp ? ) , chicken chow mein , and the curry chicken .   everything was terrific .   the hot and sour soup surprised me - i 'm not normally a very big soup fan but i thoroughly enjoyed it both at the restaurant and as left - overs the next day .      the portions of all of the orders were very big .   we had left - overs for three additional meals ."
5,"okay , i will start out by saying that i just picked this place out because it was near a bar we were going to afterward .   boy howdy , am i glad i found this little gem !   upon entering i was overwhelmed with the idea that we were in an italian friend 's grandma 's circa 1980 's dining room .   it was quaint .   it was old school .   it kinda made me a little nervous ! 

 the general feel of the waiter we had was extremely laid back .   traditional italian dude who was a little tardy in checking back , etc .   our water glass was never refilled .   got a little more nervous . 

 they brought out really good looking bread and poured some herbed olive oil out for me ( i declined because i have celiac disease and ca n't have regular bread . ) .   my husband said the bread and the olive oil was amazing .   i had called ahead and they said they had many gluten free options . 

 i ordered the chicken al berto .   my husband ordered veal and a side of spaghetti with meat sauce .   we started with a tomato caprese appetizer .   the tomato was slightly under ripe but the mozza and basil made up for it ... and in the center was a bunch of roasted red peppers which totally made the dish !   nom nom nom .   the balsamic was excellent as well .   i must now do peppers with my caprese ! 

 then our entrees came out .   my chicken had fontina cheese , pancetta and spinach .   there was a little line of mushrooms in a marsala sauce which i 'm not sure if it was supposed to be there or not .   i 'm super happy it was !   this is close to if not the best chicken dish i 've eaten .   the chicken was moist which is usually questionable in italian restaurants i 've found .   the quality of the fontina cheese was impeccable .   the pancetta was crisp and plentiful .   then i tasted the mushrooms ! ! ! ! omg ! !   freaking amazing !   i may have to try the chicken marsala sometime just to have more mushrooms !   divine .  

 it took a while to eat , mainly due to the waiter 's "" chill "" attitude but we shall go back again and again and again .   i do n't care if you do n't get anything included with your main entree .   the portion of entrees were huge .   my husband loved both his veal dish and said the meat sauce was one of the best he 's had .   fresh , fresh , fresh . 

 it 's on my new list of first priority restaurants .   and i think the prices were pretty good .   less than $ 15 for my chicken , $ 20 for the veal and $ 10 for the caprese .   i 'm so there next week ! 

 oh , and put your phone on vibrate .   they kind of insist !   and that 's okay too !"
4,"ok , so really . how can you go wrong with burgers ? i guess it 's a just little absurd to me that people dress up to eat a burger . or that people choose to drink a glass of pricey wine instead of say , a root beer float with their burger . speaking of which , their rootbeer float is too pricey for what you get .... 

 at any rate , i took my brother to eat here once upon a time , for kicks and giggles . see what all the hype is about . we were actually seated really quickly on a busy night , and quickly ordered our burgers . they were good . that goes without saying . and i really enjoyed the decor and the fries in the mini shopping cart ! yes , something so ridiculous it is adorable . i do n't really like having to order fries separate , because i think they should just come with your burger , but i digress . the burgers were juicy , came out fast and piping hot , cooked to our specifications , and surprisingly , not too much more expensive than my childhood fave , red robbins . ok fine , at least their fries had yummalicious dipping sauces . 

 i 'd go again , just not on a busy night . and maybe i 'd dress up a little more . but then i 'd feel crazy - like , why am i wearing a dress to eat a burger ? but i do like those fancy - schmancy burgers ... i guess i can suck it up ."
3,"i have always enjoyed the quesdillas at chili 's . try their happy hour where they offer bottled and draft beers . there chicken tenders are okay but they are breaded and i do not care for breaded chicken tenders but rather the grilled ones which they do not offer . the salsa here is not very good , i have tasted store bought salsa that tastes much better . the best thing chili 's has to offer is the happy hour ."
4,"got a great deal from home run.com and used it to find some good cigars . 
 staff is friendly and very knowledgeable ."
3,"i think the lady behind the counter did n't like me .   could 've just been me .   i do n't know .   it 's just how i felt . 

 when my boss first told me about this place , i thought he said "" al molina "" and i was like , "" you mean the guy who played doc ock in spider - man ii ? "" 

 i 've been here a few times , today was the first time i 'd been to el molino in about 8 months .   i happened to be in the area , popping in to buy a backpack at staples an decided to get a burrito to go to munch on when i got back to my office . 

 one thing i really did n't like was that you had to ask for the key to use the bathroom .   that 's something very typical of , like , a gas station that bums use to shit on the floor .   i went to the bathroom and it said i had to ask for the key .   i went back to the counter and the woman disappeared in the back so i kinda just did a little pee - pee dance until she came back . 

 it was a little too expensive for what it was .   a thing of chips was like $ 4.50 .   that 's crazy .   granted , the chips are really good and you get a lot of em , but ... do n't you have a thing of chips i can buy for a buck that comes with a much more reasonable portion ?   i got all these chips in the fridge at work that wo n't be edible on monday , probably . 

 the burrito i got was very tasty .   the salsa they gave me was also super good .   nice and smokey and spicy .   seriously .   man , that shit was spicy .   i kind of have a soar throat today so that spiciness felt super good to me . 

 i had to laugh when i opened up my to - go back once i got back to work because i actually thought maybe i did n't get any salsa , but when i took a look they gave me soooo much .   i made a small tower beside my meal , like a stonehenge of heat . 

 three stars :   good .   not great .   weird bathroom .   unfriendly lady .   good food .   too expensive ."
5,"where else can you go in chandler the will transport you to another country for free in a flash ! ! 

 i like to shop here and explore the foods of other countries .   this is not just an oriental supermarket , they are a world market .   each aisle jets you to a different culture or country . 

 i wish most of all their sake selection was better but oh well , they are bound by the limitations of their distributors . 

 i will be there again soon for a mini - staycation ! ! ! !"
4,"this place is cleaner than lee lee . in addition , there is an authentic chinese cafe , chinese bbq and chinese bakery inside the supermarket and their quality is okay . the bbq session is better than the one in lee lee . 
 you can get discount by paying $ 100 upfront for $ 110 shopping coupons , that is equivalent to about 10 % discount . 
 in addition , this place does sell some luxury food that lee lee does not offer ."
5,i 'm usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it .   i ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor .   our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly .   for the size and price - order multiples .   love the salsa bar .   adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat .
4,because sometimes you just want to flip the bird at calorie counting and healthy living .   this valley landmark is the place for satisfying that once in awhile sinful urge to screw up your carefully laid out dietary plans .
5,"it does n't matter which location you go to , it 's all the same and great ! ! !"
1,"i would 've gone 2 stars if i were more forgiving . i could reason that it was the end of the day , that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through , or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant . but then , i tasted it . 

 it looks as if yogurtini is pretty well - loved around these parts , and i 'm sorry to report otherwise . it 's was like a bomb had gone off . the tables were filthy , the machine handles were all gunked up , there was assorted debris on the floor . the two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs . when we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins , with no employees in sight . we grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles ( and other customers ) to try some different flavors . the levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand , especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup . this mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation , and no - one attempting to clean it up . 

 the stuff was real overpowering , to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like , it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be . like , cheesecake does n't taste like that , good cheesecake anyway ... and neither does cake batter , or banana . where did the yogurt part go ? and how do you screw up cookies and cream , exactly ? the two that were the best ( and most edible ) were the irish mint and the red velvet , and that 's what we mostly ended up with . 

 the decor did n't add to our experience . everything is a mint green , but it does n't come off as retro or even minty , but more like dated and hospital - like . some people really like it but i found it unappetizing . 

 a surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register , only to disappear again soon after we paid . we sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance , half - mopping - half - attempting - to - clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes . we finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair . 

 i very well could have walked into yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day , with all the factors stacked against them , but i wo n't be returning to find out if this was the case ."
4,"fun trivia ! food is mediocre . crowd was cool and there is plenty to do there ( video games , darts etc .. ) when i 'm back in tempe visiting friends i know we 'll be back . bonus for having the misters and a great seating area outside . we met some very nice locals who were up for a good chat ."
4,"tonight was great . i had a calzone , pepperoni and olive ,   coppola zinfandel , the wife had a pizza with nice and hot jalapenos . the staff was nice , so much that we made comments to each other about the quality ."
5,"upon first look pearl does not look like my type of place .   trendy location / atmosphere often equals mediocre   food . pearl is an exception to the rule . the sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock . i love that they have different flavors for edamame , cheap bombers and did i mention the fish sticks are way to good . all of that would equal four stars in my book , fifth star is given to the staff . steve is the type of bartender that others should aspire to be like . knowledgeable and observant without being intrusive . always goes the extra mile , i really appreciate how he makes my husband and i feel so comfortable . overall great value and relaxed attitude ."
1,"when i was growing up we called this the canal . in other parts of town it is still called the canal . in some places people actually fish from it . i think they die right after they eat their catch , which is why you do n't see them very often . over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well .   google it . 

 what is so annoying about this is that scottsdale , is trying to make it seem like this is n't the same heinous canal that 's always been there . when i heard about the development around the scottsdale waterfront , i could n't figure out what they were talking about . what water ? then i started cracking up when i found out it was the canal . 

 come on scottsdale , you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig , but it is still a pig . you are not fooling anyone ."
4,this place will kind of throw you off when you first step with the wall nic nacs and the display that sells body wash and toothpaste next to chop sticks and such but the food is surprisingly delicious .. my husband order the chicken curry friee rice with orange chicken and he loved it . i had the chicken and beef chop suey and was not disappointed . kudos to this joint could do with some spring cleaning and a little sprucing up but good all the same
3,"why review a fast food chain ?   for me , this particular sonic is close to where i work .   because there are n't many options when pressed for   time i 'm able to walk or drive here and grab a quick bite to eat .   like most fast food chains it 's about consistency , knowing what you 're going to get and getting it quickly .   that 's what this sonic location does well .   plus , who can pass up hot and crispy tater tots ? ? 

 3 stars because , on principle , i think that 's the most any fast food place can reasonably expect ."
5,i love their beef sandwiches and thin crust pizza . it is just like being back in chicago . love it !
5,"zin , zin , zin - yes , yes , yes ! 
 several weeks ago five of us had a wonderful monday evening at zinburger with our delightful server , candace . i arrived early , inquiring about the left handed polestar pilsner , candace offered a sample , very tasty - with three of my party eventually having it with dinner . 
 we had a great booth - giving us a vantage point , watching the parade of customers & employees . i really like the airy , roomy , high energy vibe . 
 with our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces an 
 a subtle breading on the zucchini . 
 we all tried different burgers , with some of us tasting each others , candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us - nice touch . the meat is flavorful , melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun . 
 fun , cool atmosphere & great food - made for a great get away , early in the week . 
 my hats off to the sam fox team , another winner at zinburger ."
5,"just off university , but manages to feel like a little hide - away , and pulls off an enticing mellow atmosphere , suitable for intimate conversation . 

 fish tacos and a margarita again please ! how many times before i can force myself to experiment ?"
4,"this is a nice asian take - out style restaurant ( you can order and sit down too ) . the portions are pretty big , and they have a good selection . waaaaaay better than pei wei which is in the same shopping center . 

 the only downside is their breading is a little heavy , but other than that i have enjoyed everything i have tried there ."
5,"these guys have the tacos and nachos thing figured out . great decor and hot , hot waitresses . 

 we had lunch and it was pretty quiet . good service . i 'm sure things get crazy at night , though !"
5,"i have been coming here since discovering them after their opening week last year and i have n't stopped coming back . the food is predominantly filipino ; the filipino - mexican fusion comes in the burritos , flautas and quesadillas filled with filipino meat dishes . a great starter would be the chicken adobo burrito . karey 's does it right by not dumping rice and fillings inside the burrito ; they 're served on the side . 

 for those more interested in rice plates and combinations , karey 's serves daily prepared dishes such as pork adobo and chicken adobo ( pork or chicken simmered in garlic and soy vinaigrette ) and beef mechado ( a type of stew with beef chunks , potatoes , and onions in a light tomato gravy ) with either white rice or garlic fried rice ( yummy ) . there are also specials that rotate each day , which can be checked out on their twitter account . this is a great idea as one can find out when they are serving lechon ( roasted pig ) ! yum ! 

 there are dishes that can be prepared fresh but are not part of the combination specials .   the ones i 've tried that i highly recommend are their lumpia ( fried eggrolls in chicken , beef , or vegetable ) and pancit canton ( stir - fried noodles with vegetables ) . the pork lumpia was great when they used to serve it , and i preferred it to the beef lumpia that they serve now ... but it 's still good ;) 

 not only is the food delicious but the warmth of the staff is something to always look forward to . karen and rey make you feel truly at home . the best thing about karey 's kitchen is having a filipino restaurant in phoenix and not having to drive all the way to the east or west valley !"
3,"earl 's is earl 's - not great - not bad . if you 're in the neighborhood and do n't have anywhere else to go , go to earl 's . by far there are better choices , but earl 's will do when you 're in a pinch . 

 typical bar food with no particular edge to make it memorable . 

 the staff is very friendly and the service is very good . 

 just average , not memorable ."
3,"i remember when this place first opened .   i was very excited since it seemed so "" humbling "" . 

 i came here for lunch and thought this place actually looks "" okay "" at best .   chicken sandwich was excellent .   the bread was toasty and crunchy , while the chicken and toppings were warm and buttery !   however , the soup can improve .   they only gave to you 2 options so i guess i had a 50/50 chance of getting the good one !  

 the place was loud and popping !   not sure what to make of it since they had wine racks and wine , but then teeny hot pink tank tops hanging from the wines .   is this supposed to make me want to drink more wine or should i buy a shirt for my gf ?   though i do n't think anyone would appreciate a shirt that says pie .  

 service was good , i guess .   our waiter was very nice and helpful , but he seemed flustered with a smile .   he did n't do anything wrong by any means except he was going about 100 more miles than i was .   - enjoy"
4,"is this great sushi ?   no .   does this food reinvent the sushi wheel ?   not even close .   will i have a foodgasm ?   not a chance . when i am craving an amazing sushi meal , i 'll go to yasu . 

 why i really , really like teharu : 
 the food is fresh .   while it 's not amazing fish , there 's nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from . 
 all the standards are readily available and if you want something not already on the belt , they 'll gladly make it for you . 
 the conveyor really feeds into my lack of patience .   i sat down , ordered an iced green tea , and started pulling plates off the belt .   yes , i was eating sushi within 90 seconds of sitting down ! 
 the price is a huge plus !   i met a friend for lunch - we each had iced tea , several plates with 3 or 4 roll slices , seaweed salad , sunumono salad and a couple nigiri and i was out of there for less than $ 20 , including tip . 
 the place is kept incredibly clean , staff is friendly and teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual , quick sushi place .   when it comes down to it , i ca n't always afford to spend what that quantity of food would cost me at yasu or any of the other great places in town - i like that i am not committing to a whole roll - i can sample from 5 or 6 different ones . 

 fills the need for the sushi craving on a buget and/or when strapped for time ."
2,"new and big yes ... but not my favorite spring training park . 

 5 stars for being big and roomy and also lots of grass in the outfield 

 2 stars for being almost like a major league park . feels like you are attending a mlb regular season game . they lost out on the small spring training feel and intimacy . 

 0 stars for being the only cactus league park i visited this spring not allowing you to bring in food like candy or peanuts or sunflower seeds . you realize why when you see the pricey beer and food vendors inside ."
4,"we stopped by switch the other night after getting raped by the irs and while we were still feeling quite sad and pathetic .   we wanted something casual , inexpensive , and fast , and that is what we got !  

 service was great !   we were one of maybe 3 inside tables and a full patio , and our waitress was fantastic .   she was very attentive and kept our drinks full . 

 we had the wedge fries , a weakness of mine , and they were pretty good .   not great , but definitely good . 

 they had several vegetarian options , and i chose the chop salad , which was so yummy .   so yummy in fact , that i have been trying to duplicate it at home for days now . 

 my husband had the turkey berry sandwich , which i did n't try ( no meat for me ) , but he said it was good .  

 we would definitely go there again . try it !"
5,"he 's been the top vote - getting general dentist in phoenix magazine for three years in a row for a reason , folks . he has an office in chandler and in mesa but even if you live in minnesota , he 's worth the drive ."
1,"pretentious and bad service - attendants are totally clueless ( though i feel for them if management makes them wear the costumes they wear ) . overpriced fashion brands .   if you want to spend $ 200 on a flannel , there are much better options out there .   run in and glance at the sale rack , otherwise avoid this place like the plague ."
4,"always good beer and good food . well let me say the food is not super fantastic but it 's better than a lot of brewery food out there . spinach dip is good , nachos are always a staple , burgers could use a re - do . salads are pretty good , pizza is mediocre . wings are not half bad ! ! sauce is pretty fiery ! nice ! ! not a wussy sauce here ! but i do love this place and the patio . beers you ca n't go wrong with . very flavorful good beers . all i ask is just a bit more quality in the food . that s all that s wrong imo or not really wrong but something they could improve on ."
2,"i liked them a lot until i had to call them to get the discount fare for the toddler but since i was booking our tickets together ( because a two year old legally ca n't fly alone so i had to ) on the phone , i was n't getting the lower internet rate .   that 's extortion !   i 'd much rather do the entire thing on the internet .   then he tells me that the child 's fare goes off of the regular rate which is only one dollar less than the internet rate .   what the hell ?   why would i ever want to sit on hold for 25 minutes to book a flight to get this crap ?   then they tried to get me to pay $ 15 more for the next class up ( i know , upper class on southwest - strange ) .   i asked what i got :   1.25 times the miles ( yeah , you heard right 25 % more - that 's going to get me far ) , first boarding and a free drink .   i clarified that with a child i get to board first anyway ( they confirmed this ) .   then i asked how much a drink costs .   $ 5 .   so essentially they are asking me to pay $ 15 instead of $ 5 for a drink i may or may not want ( then again , i 'm traveling with a child so who am i kidding , i 'm going to need a drink ) .   and to top it all off , they tell me we ca n't do on - line check in because beckham does n't have a picture id .   i tell them but he does have a picture id .   he has a passport , in fact he has two .   the southwest person tells me no one has two passports so i tell him that no , it 's true .   the toddler and i both have two as we have dual citizenship .   ( not that we would need them to fly to california so the whole conversation is entirely pointless now . )   the southwest man being the all - knowing scholar he is tells me that 's impossible and illegal .   i take a deep breathe , tell him he 's right , i 'm wrong , how stupid i am .   i must be thinking of my library card .     why are things so difficult sometimes ?"
2,"a very inadequate meal and expensive for the low quality food you get .   ordered the veal sorrentino and it was not enjoyable to eat .   very dry , tough ... just gross .   caesar salad was also disgusting and unpleasant , saturated in dressing .   i did like the atmosphere , laid back and comfortable .   knowing that pasta brioni is down the street , i wo n't go back ."
5,"my first box of ngd arrived a few weeks and tears nearly came to my eyes as i removed the produce from the box .   i have n't seen such beautiful , fresh , well packaged produce since i was a kid ( and i 'm no spring chicken ) .   the carrots tasted like the sweet carrots i remember and the lettuce ( with the dirt from the farm still fresh on the leaves ) so full of flavor .   the amazing thing is that i had come to expect most organic vegetables and fruits to be less visually appealing than the chemical type but such is not the case with ngd . 

 the medium size box has been perfect for our little family of four .   it is delivered on our day like clockwork around 2 am .   the unseen elf that drops off the goodies is nice enough to open the carton and place all the contents in our cooler so everything stays nice in this boiling cauldron we call phoenix .   furthermore , i live way out in carefree / cave creek where we always expect to be on the list of places too far away for delivery .   not with ngd .   it appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas . 

 finally , there is a gentleman named ben that works for ngd .   he has been very helpful in making sure everything is going smoothly and that we are using the service properly . 

 we think ngd is a great value for organic produce delivered to your door and highly recommend ngd !"
5,"family friendly and we love the soups and salads .   mushroom soup is our favorite ! ! ! !   we also enjoy their veggie sandwich but all of them that we have tried are delicious .   sunday brunch is great too .   we do frittatas or banana pancakes , yum .   or a simple wildflower capaccino and scone does the trick .   we'be been going for years and will continue to go .   oh , did i mention the free wifi ?   great for some business lunches ."

5,"my mother and i were actually getting out of the car to go to streets of new york next door when she smelled the mexican food and suggested we try roberto 's instead .   that should tell you what you need to know right there . 

 it 's a hole in the wall place for sure , and leaves much to be desired visually , but the staff was exceptionally pleasant and the tables were clean .   if you 're looking for fine dining , this is n't your place .   at $ 7-$10 for an entree , though , it was delicious . 

 beans , rice , and chips were pretty standard , but the salsa , fish taco , and shredded beef tostada were very flavorful .   the food tastes homemade , and in this case , that 's a good thing . 

 this place was also featured on tlc 's diners and drive - ins show back in the day .   one of anthem 's best kept secrets .   i 'll be back !"
5,"creative healing solutions is a fantastic naturopathic doctors office .       i 'm so grateful that i found this place and met dr. roxie strand and her wonderful assistant , melissa .   my life has changed so much for the better since april 2012 when i walked into her office super frustrated with many previously unsuccessful weight loss attempts .    dr. roxie was attentive and thorough , and suggested i consider hcg .    i had never heard of it before then , so i went home and did my research .   i was a little nervous , but never felt any pressure and when i decided to give it a try , i felt very at ease being under her supervision .   now , i 'm 85 lbs lighter and feel better than i have in years .    i could go on and on and speak to how wonderful the program , office and dr. strand are , but i simply suggest that you consider visiting dr. roxie yourself if you are seeking to address medical issues that you have n't been able to solve before .   she does a free consultation and is genuinely interested in helping find a holistic health solution for you .    i never thought i could totally change my lifestyle , but dr. roxie definitely helped me find a way to do it and has been a major supporter in my journey , which i appreciate so much !     whether you are in need of a weight loss solution or need someone to help with other medical matters , i fully recommend dr. strand ."
3,"food was decent , smaller portions which is good , friendly service . not the cleanest but a decent meal with good prices . it would get 4 stars if the food had just a little more flavor ."
4,"this chili 's is n't a lot different than the one on mill .   however , not being on mill does have its advantages with not being full of college kids all the time .   the service is pretty good and it 's crowded all that often .   you can have a quiet dinner here more than at the one on mill .   pretty good chili 's here ."
5,"this place seems to get better every time i visit . the first time was a friday night out with the guys . we met up for dinner and i had ( and loved ) the pulled pork and sweet potato fries . after dinne we got our drink on with a live band . the waitress was helpful in getting us drunk off a variety of liquors . and the shots kept on coming ! it was a blast . the second time was more laid back , just grabbing a beer with a girlfriend . it was a tuesday and the place was pretty busy . the next time me and the girlfriend showed up completely wasted and they had an irish band playing . it was a perfect way to end our night after clubbing at the gay bar ! we had a baileys nightcap and everything went dark from there . awesome night !"
4,"great food at reasonable prices in a good atmosphere . 

 our family has been regulars for over seven years at the w. iron location . the food is fantastic , you ca n't beat it for breakfast and the lunch sandwiches are great . we 've noticed a big difference in the staff since managment changed . many of the new servers are not as attentive as they should be but the long time servers never disappoint . 

 if you go on the weekend prepare to wait , sometimes up to an hour . on sunday if you arrive before 9:30 the wait is n't that long ."
5,"this is by far the best and most authentic mexican food i 've had in this area of town . i try and get different dishes each time i visit and have yet to be disappointed . 

 if you 're looking for an amazing location / view / atmosphere , this probably is n't the place for you . if you 're looking for amazing food , then you 've come to the right place . 

 the prices are great for what you get . the quesadillas are served on a pizza tray so bring your appetite !"
4,"just spent two years in austin eating bbq from all over the state . 

 this place is legit ..... for phoenix . 

 world class sausage and excellent brisket !  

 sides were average .   nothing much exciting there . 

 the bread was killing both me and the quality of the meat . 

 the sauce is too sweet .   it would be great for st. louis style ribs , but this is texas ... put some spice in there ."
4,"3 kids and myself .. 14 bucks .. got ta love a tuesday kids eat free . while i still had to buy two adults to get two kids free ... totally worth it . 

 the place was clean , service excellent . 

 the pizza was looking pretty bad when we goth there but after eating some ok salad , the fresh ones rolled out and were great . 

 garlic cheese bread type 
 pep , ham and jalapeno 
 chicken wing 

 they were all great . 

 cinnamon roll for dessert ... yummy ! 

 really if you have not been here for a few years come back with an open attitude and a hunger to pack in some pizza , chicken , mashed taters , spaghetti , salad , dessert and of course pizza ... any kind you want , they will try to make it ."
2,"when tempe market place was being put together ... i though wow a swanky place where college kids and laid back adults could get together and enjoy themselves .   cadillac ranch was being built ... and the hype was hot enough to make you buy a meal ahead of time .   read the reviews but thought ... what they hey lets try it out .   and now i see why it has two stars ... should have listened to the other yelpers -_- ... went there is good ole ' rada , thought it would be nice to enjoy the day outside .   nearly drowned by the ample amount of misters .   thought to self ... hmm well at least the food should be good .   ordered the sliders meal ... maybe they were scarce on meat , but the slider patties were the size of silver dollars , tasty but small .   yes the service was slow ; my glass was getting refilled faster by the misters than the actual waiter . it gets two stars in my book for the service and the overall experience ( for lunch that is ) . you get what you pay for .. and for 11 bucks , a couple barbie sized patties in human size buns , a not so ' ahh ' diet coke , and 5 oz of wine ( and that 's on the 2.00 happy hour deal ) ... kind of seems appropriate . 
  i recommend this if you are stuck hanging around tempe market place and you have just a few bucks and feel like getting close to full ... 
 and now i think that tempe market place took mill ave 's charm ... and they need to step up to compensate killing a once adorned chill out spot for asu and tempe .   shopping is good ... we could deff replace cr for perhaps sakana ? who knows ... 
 bye for now !"
1,"beware of the hidden   65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you do n't drink tea ?   really . 

 the crazy thing is , i 'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill ? 

 when i mentioned it to the cashier , she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said   "" oh , is this your 1st time ?   we can remove it from the bill "" 

 i said forget it , keep it . 

 i usually tip 20 - 30 % but i 'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge . 

   yeah , really worth losing a customer for ? 

 my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water . 

 gone are the $ 2.15 per item flat rate ( can you say bait and switch ? ) 

 $ 2.35 per so now they 're no different from the rest of the dim sum places . 

 as sneaky as c - foo trying to strong arm the 15 % gratuity ( which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers ) 

 so in a down economy , you 're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges ? 

 it 's the chinese way i guess 

 back to china king for us .   sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace . 

 will you forgive us ? haha"
1,"we came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife , we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees . we were then informed that we could n't order dinner . maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are ... here for dinner ... they might give them a heads up that the kitchen is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close .. fourth time we 've given this place a and got crappy service . bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner , needless to say we wo n't be giving them another chance . not good gordon b. not good ."
4,"by far one of my favorite places to have breakfast . the intimate setting gives off the "" mom and pop "" breakfast joint feel you might find in a beach town . the menu accomodates for the health - conscious but breakfast - loving eater . the only reason why i knocked it down a point is the wait . unless you go during the weekdays or early morning on the weekends , expect to wait upwards to 45 minutes . my suggestions ... their egg white omelets and for those coffee lovers , you have to try the bc coffee !"
2,"heed the negative reviews . 

 this restaurant can be summed up in two words : mediocre & overpriced . i wish i had gone with my instinct and given more weight to the negative reviews . the positive reviews of the spring rolls lured me in , however , much to my disappointment . one spring roll is $ 4.50 , although we fortunately went for the happy hour and only paid $ 3.50 , which was still too much , in my opinion . they were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor . , and we tried 3 different kinds . the peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls . 

 i had the lemon grass chicken for dinner . the chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were overly sweet . i could n't detect even a hint of the lemon grass . the presentation was unappetizing , with the overcooked chicken just slapped on to the side of the noodles . 

 i 'm not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably did n't want to be negative , but neither of them made any positive comments about their food . 

 as i said , pay attention to the negative reviews . if you like bland , overpriced food , you may like this place , but otherwise i ca n't see anyone going back for more ."
5,"had to update because we 've now tried the pizza ! for all the times we have visited we 've never tried a pizza ( too many other really good options to choose i guess ... ) 

 we ordered the italian classic ( veggies & meat ) . we ordered it a little well done / crispy and were not disappointed ! it was hot , fresh and cooked perfectly ! 

 service was great as usual even though they were completely slammed with customers the day before thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time ! 

 we were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans , potatoes , two eggs and fresh warm tortillas .   it was fantastic ! this dish , just like many others ( possibly all others ) is plenty for 2 to share . 

 service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and az won - so there were a lot of happy customers that day !"
5,"a big shout out to mike , the stupendously stellar bar manager .   i will be back to discuss the history of vodka . 

 thank you to restaurant gm , anibal , who stopped by to see us not once , but twice .   enjoyed the education regarding the secretive life of truffles . 

 aaron , the fantastically knowledgeable sommelier , had me paired with excellent wine suggestions with only a few hints of my picky palette .  

 appreciated the manger of stone rose , sam ,   coming all the way over from the other side to dropped in and sat with us to chat about upcoming events . 

 ca n't wait to go back to try out there new bar bite menu in 2 weeks , and take advantage of the locals ' secret   1/2 off bottle night on tuesdays from there amazingly huge book of wines to choose from .  

 thanks again everyone : you made a potentially disastrous date night from visiting an establishment previous which ( to say the least ) did not go well , into a very enjoyable and fun evening ."
5,"love the buffet , the folks that work there are great , we usually hit this at least once a weekend and our table is always ready and he knows what sort of naan we want . small but worth it ."
4,"i have been searching for a good pho restaurant ever since saigon pho in chandler went down hill .   pho van is a very clean , well organized , and well staffed restaurant in the asian center that shares space with lee lee 's and other shops .  

 i had the traditional pho ga ( chicken soup in beef broth ) and goi cuon ( spring rolls ) .   both were very good .   the noodles in the broth were perfectly cooked and had great texture and the chicken was all white meat and very tender .   the veggies that accompany the pho were fresh and crisp .   the spring rolls were perfect as well stuff full of healthy green veggies .  

 the prices were a little higher than i am used to in a pho place but it was not bad .   they also do not accept amex so beware if that is all you use .  

 overall a great place and this is my new go - to - pho in the valley ."
4,"i have n't been here in quite a while , but when i was coming here , they had a jazz band doing rock and alternative covers ( their name is the latest , though i do n't think they play here anymore ) . the place is totally trendy , but i really see that as a good thing here ."
4,"cibo does n't appear to need my review , since they have a lot of fans here and other places .   this is a good lunch spot if you can get there early enough to avoid a wait .   the patio is particularly nice when the weather permits .   i work about five blocks from here and i 've only been there for lunch .   i 've wanted to try dinner but something about coming all the way back downtown after i 've driven home to gilbert just does n't appeal .   maybe on a day off sometime .   the food is great .   i like the speck sandwich .   speck , for the uninitiated , is just another kind of cured ham like prosciutto .   the bread is always perfectly toasted .   currently they offer as sides a salad , fruit , or chips .   an orzo salad , a la carly 's , would be a nice addition ."
1,"look it upsets me that you have to give even one star . 

 i can read the other reviews and i have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner . 

 yes , we were the table of 7 people at about 8 pm , yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together . you would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/2 of a waiter . it was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch . 

 you know what sucks more than working 2 shifts ? how about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts , it was so nice of the manager to let him leave , but hey how about taking the time to have someone finish the open orders ? 

 simply the food was not good and you are over priced . 

 but the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job , they dont care and that is a result of management not caring ."
5,""" fine dining "" is not just a setting .   it is n't just good food .   it is many things that add up to an attitude . i have had the opportunity to find it in different cities . i found it the other night at the stockyards . 

 we were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus .   our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly .   it was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering .   when she did return ,   our glasses were filled - not something we should have   to wait for her to do when the service is right .   she knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them .   our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as i could ask for .   when my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate .   i was pleased when they did n't ask me if i was finished with my salad and could they take my plate .   if i 'd been finished i could have told them .   we were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as i finished my salad .   the salad plate was removed   when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served .   all was in keeping with a relaxed dining .   at no time did i have to think about having drinks refilled , it just happened quietly . 

 after a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started .   there was no room for error there that could n't be resolved before we started .  

 my friend had ordered a small steak . my friend is   quite elderly and kathy , our server , discretely asked her if she 'd like it cut for her .   a potato also was served with her dish .   i asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with .   she look at me and said "" prepared with ? "" she did n't understand what i was getting at but kathy did and was already reaching for the potato .    she opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything .   one does n't go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it .    when serving is done properly , these things do n't have to be discussed .   kudos to , kathy!!!.   that is part of the fine dining experience . 

 i had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them .   the sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed .   i also can tell you that unless you are a big eater , half a rack would fill most people .   my friend said , "" yummy ! ""   and i agreed .   i am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating , but i ca n't complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs .  

 my friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert .   i can assure you the pecan pie is a delight !   warm and laced with brandy , it was perfect way to finish our dinner . 

 the stockyards , i might mention , is not inexpensive , but what an enjoyable way to spend your money . they do offer two dinner specials you wo n't find at most other places .   they do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices .    do n't expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer .   instead , just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the stockyards . 

 i do n't consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and nike 's , but of course there are always a few .   i would say a nice shirt and slacks at least ."
4,"came here last night with the girlies to satisfy our craving for indian food .   we 've talked about this place for a while , and i 'll be damned if i was leaving az before stopping by this place !   so luckily , i was able to convince one of the girls that finals are not as important as saying goodbye to me over a plate of curries . 

 we got their around 8 and the place had a good crowd .   we were the only white girls , so we know we were in for a good meal .   going over the menu took us a while , because one of the girls had no clue what she wanted , and the server was polite enough to let us take our time . 

 before we figured out what we wanted for dinner , of course we had to figure out drinks .   so we all order and still continue to peruse the menu .   then our drinks came out ... huge plus for this place right here , they were huge !   my gin and tonic was in an oversized cocktail glass and my friend 's chardonnay was filled to the brim .   no skimping on alcohol here !   the waiter advised us the drinks were strong , which i was fine with but my girlfriend needed 3 more limes to take hers down . 

 we finally end up decided on dinner , with the shahih paneer , chicken saag , and vegetable korma , and an order of garlic naan .   i was a little unsure about the paneer , but my girlfriends swore by it . 

 when the food arrived , we were excited !   everything smelled so flavorful and the naan was huge , good thing we only got one order .   i loved every single bite i had at dinner , and the feeling was mutual across the table .   all of us ate beyond the point of feeling full , but we could n't help ourselves !   this food was too good ! 

 luckily , we were able to stop ourselves and save some food to take home .   i got the chicken saag and i am so excited to have some for my own brunch .   mmmmm ... i'm getting hungry thinking about it now . 

 overall , $ 20 a person including tip , with strong drinks , good food , and extras to take home we were satisfied ."
3,"just kind of there with nothing special about this convention center . and the phoenix downtown area is pretty boring and sparse except for the baseball stadium right next to it with some cool bars and restaurants . when there is n't a game , this area seems pretty dead . 

 bottom line : ho hum . baseball stadium nearby is great entertainment option but can be a pain with all the traffic if you are trying to get out of the convention center area in the evening ."
4,"i have been to this place a couple of times and so far each time has been a great experience for the most part .   the food is awesome , and the atmosphere is fun and friendly ( definitely family oriented , with a lot of outdoor seating ) . 

 out of the two times that i have been here , i have tried their fontina burger , the pesto chicken sandwich , the sweet potato fries , and the garlic fries . the burger was delicious , the chicken in the pesto chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection , and the fries were awesome ( although , the garlic fries had too much garlic for my taste ) . 

 the only downside is that this place is always packed   ( or at least the two times that i have been here ) .   it was featured on the food network , so i kind of knew that it was a popular place . but the funny thing is that i thought if going at a later time for lunch and on a weekday that it would n't be bad , but i was wrong and the line was still out the door .   also , i kind of wanted to try their milkshakes , but the line was way too long to get back into ( sort of wish they had an express line for desserts ) . 

 oh , and check out their restroom for a weird / funny surprise ."
2,"just o.k .   we had the italian stallion , it tasted very good , but between 2 adults left us pretty hungry .   for 14 dollars , it seemed to be more of an appetizer ."
2,"meh is right . this place was a big yawn for me ... 

 i went with a group of 5 ( well , 4 adults , one kiddo ) . this is another one of those places that tries to be fancy and pretty much sucks -- for the price and portion size anyway . we ordered beef stew , chorizo stuffed dates , halibut , cheeze sticks , chicken and white cheddar waffles , and some beers . 

 first on the beers ... they have four peaks 8th street on tap ( privately labeled as tucks ale or something like that ) and i was happy to see this -- i love this beer . however , halfway into my meal my glass was dry and it sat that way for a good 10 minutes . if you 've read any of my other yelps , you know i expect a refill promptly , especially if you expect me for forget your marginal service and mediocre food ... 

 when the waitress came around , she asked if i wanted another beer , i said yes . another 10 minutes went by , me parched , growing annoyed ... when she came around again it was clear she forgot all about me , then asked one of my friends if they wanted another beer -- i assertively said yes . she looked at me and proclaimed her sorrow , said it would be right up . another 10 minutes go by , she swings by and apologizes that they had to change the keg . i understand that -- but between the first and second time i asked , i watched the bartender pour another 4 or 5 8th streets . but i did n't get one . 

 as for the food ? super duper bland . come on tuck 's ! fancy ( read expensive ) food should be an explosion of complex flavor in my mouth . if i have to put table salt and pepper on it just to taste something , you pretty much suck . if we pay $ 30 + per person and i leave hungry , you pretty much suck . the fried chicken was pretty good , but i 've had the same quality stuff from the deli at safeway . 

 overall , not impressed and see no reason to return . if you 're taking a girl out on a first date who is more into atmosphere than food -- she 'll probably think you are the man . but really , do you want a girl like that ?"
3,"party of 7 please .   do you have a happy hour ? yes , handing me a placard with 6 appetizers that are 1 - 2 dollars off ..   ok , give me one of everything , please . i 'm used to saving more than a dollar at happy hour but , the apps are good . 

 our waitress cj then explains in thai to my wife and daughter a couple of the dishes .   we order 7 entrees and they arrive in a timely fashion and were all quite tasty . 

 problem 1   the sticky rice which came with the pork dish was about the size of two of my fingers , should have been at least 4x -10x as much . 

 problem 2 .   the rice which came with 2 of our entress was fine but , we ordered extra rice and , that did n't show up until most of the main dishes were gone .   even after asking a second and third time , it took 4 - 5 minutes for them to scoop it out of the rice cooker and bring it ,   not cool , guys . 

 this is my third time here and it is ok but , 5 stars?--not ."
4,"stopped in last night for a take out dinner . i wanted to bring home something different than burgers or a pizza or fried chicken . so i used my yelp app .... and showed yusefs nearby with good reviews . 

 the owner was a very personable person .... and very helpful . everything smelled wonderful , and it was pretty busy .... all good signs . 

 i order 2 of the falafel dinner plates , and the stuffed grape leaves plate . the only "" side "" for a dinner plate was the split pea soup . it was a generous portion .... and very good ! 

 the falafel and grape leave were both generous portions .... and delicious ! 

 i want to go back a do a little grocery shopping for some of the unique items that i think you could find only in phoenix here . 

 good job yusef ! i liked it !"
5,"i love christmas - time and i especially love it because i know that luminarias is back and this year it 's better than ever ! the staff and volunteers at the dbg do an excellent job of directing guests through the garden . between the well - lit paths ( with luminarias of course ) , helpful staff and amazing acts , this is an event not to be missed ! i consider this to be the ultimate activity for adults . it 's romantic if you 're on a date , it 's festive if you 're with your family and it 's just pure fun if you 're with friends . 

 you enter the park to be immediately greeted by hundreds of meowganificant luminarias lighting up the entire garden . cocktail stations lie in every knook and cranny and they serve delicious festive drinks like my favorite , hot cocoa and raspberry vodka ! if you 're hungry , they sell food throughout the garden at two locations . then there are the performers . the dbg does an amazing job of bringing in musicians of every shape and size . whether it 's a trio of christmas carolers , a mariachi band or a lively jazz band , they have bands in every corner lighting up the night ! i am also continuously impressed with the acoustics of the garden . with so many live acts in one area , you can barely hear a specific act until you are in that area . their event planners did an amazing job ! 

 luminarias is my favorite arizona activity during the holidays and i ca n't wait to go back next year ! !"
4,"went to this place on the recommendation of a friend and definitely was n't disappointed .   the burgers were great and the music was perfect for the time of day .   there was a good crowd and the staff was very friendly . 

 i would deinitely hit up this place the next time i am in az ."
1,"this may be my worst dining experience ever . 

 the scenery was beautiful , we ca n't complain about that . the menu was decent , there was a good number of selections to choose from . however the prices were definitely high , we 're just talking tacos & burritos here ... 

 i ordered a taco salad with steak . it was $ 11.99 , for lunch ... which i thought was crazy .   when i got the salad , it was the cheap iceberg lettuce , with a couple tomatoes & a few onions . the steak was discusting . i would n't feed a dog that steak meat . i asked the waiter for some salad dressing , he gave me this funny look and said "" most people just use salsa , but i guess i can get you some ranch or something "" . great service , huh ? i asked the waiter about the margarittas , and he willingfully told me that the 3 cheapest ones are no good and are too watered down . nice ... so i then asked about the patron margaritta ( my fav tequilla ) . the patron rita was $ 16 ! ! ! 

 the waiter was extremely unprofessional , and even gave us this pitch about how he 's only working there until he finds a new "" gig "" . the prices were ridiculous ! i would never go there again and hope to share my story with many people before they waste their money ! !"
2,"i finally saved up the amount i am willing to spend to make my backyard not look like tent city . mind you , i have never been to tent city but i have a feeling they look similar . minus the pool . 

 my backard is set up where the pool takes up the entire yard and then a maximum of 5 feet surrounding rock space around the entire pool . welcome to my backyard . 

 this makes planting difficult . my original dream was to plant oleanders along every wall , let them grow super tall to block all of my neighbors and give me the privacy i 've always wanted to skinny dip all summer long . do n't judge . 

 i wanted oleanders because they sounded like a match made in heaven for my lack of green thumb . they 're cheap , they flower , they grow fast and they 're impossible to kill . well , i found out oleanders roots are too aggressive to be that close to my pool so sadly , no go . ( i only have 5 ft , they need 10 - 15 ft ) 

 i called moon valley to get some ideas so i could do research root systems . the guy on the phone just wanted to get me there . i told him i was looking for suggestions before heading there on this rainy day and he just kept saying in the cheesiest voice known to man ' oh ya , come on down , we have hundreds ' . 

 you have hundreds of plants that are identical to oleanders minus the roots and resemble in price ? really ? ? ? please list them so i can find out if you 're a big fat liar . nope , not listing them . only wanted to get me there . i decided not to go because 1 . it 's raining , 2 . he lied and said oleanders are ok . i just have to have the drip system on 24/7 . thanks for your freakin help .   3 . he 's a liar so even if i went they would lie to me . 4 . i hate liars 5 . i went in before in the past and told them what i wanted , they gave me a free backyard design and they completely did n't listen to me and created a backyard that cost 2k . who do they think i am ? i live in mesa for crying out loud . not paradise valley . i was n't going to let them waste my time like that again . 

 if you 're wondering why i could give them a 2nd chance after that- it 's bc this time * i * was going to wear the pants in the relationship . 

 you could have had my entire ( low ) budget moon valley , but the unwillingness to help or be honest means i will be going elsewhere . someplace that will straight up say ' i can fulfill your skinny dipping in privacy dreams , while making your backyard look pretty as cheaply as possible and i wo n't destroy your pool while i 'm at it '"
5,"food truck fav right here ! 

 i 've been wanting to try pizza people 's pizza for a while now .   i found out they were setting up at 180 degree 's automotive and i figured if bogi was hosting them then i needed to check them out !   i finally caught up with them at local fest . 

 bogi was actually there helping them out and she told me that they were only sampling the regular pizza and the gluten free pizza was $ 8 but she assured me it was yummy !   first of all $ 8 for a 2 item gf crust pizza is a deal !   secondly , bogi said they were her some of her best friends in the world ... and i trust her implicitly .... so i ponied up my dollars and waited about six minutes .   i ordered my pie with pepperoni and fresh tomato .   i took it back to my table to share with my mama ( who is also gluten free ) and we both said at about the same time : "" oh , my gosh this is really good ! ""    something i 've only said about twice since eating gf pizza ! 

 the sauce is fresh , the dough was the best gf dough i 've had to date and the toppings were just divine .   i need to put a gps tracking unit on this truck so i can track it daily ! ( oh , wait ......... i can just check their facebook page ! )   yeah , i 'd eat it daily !   it 's that good !"
1,horrible service . twice now i 've gone there and they keep messing up my drink . i work for starbucks ! ! it 's not hard to get a drink right ! believe me . horrible service . the people that work there all have bad attitude . one lady does n't even look at you when your ordering your drink . i think that someone needs to go in there and fix it and make it a welcoming starbucks that it 's known for . ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore . i stopped going . they still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee . horrible .
5,"mesa amphitheatre is easily my favorite concert venue in the phoenix area .   you can see and hear from anywhere in the place , and the grassy risers were such a good idea .   the sound was excellent for the two shows i 've been to there .   really just an overall nice , peaceful place to see a show and enjoy the arizona weather .   parking is n't too bad and neither are the lines to get in where they check your bags .   to top it all of , getting out of there was a breeze both times i was there ."
5,"my dentist recommended this place to me five years ago and every since then , i keep a keen ear to any of her recommendations as shimagamo is the best sushi i 've had anywhere .   i 've had sushi in ca , ny , tx and hi .   

 the fish tastes fresh and the portions are generous .   one piece of advice is to eat at the sushi bar rather than one of the booths , assuming you are having sushi .   in my experience , sushi tastes better served as soon as each sushi piece prep is done rather than waiting for the entire sushi order to be completed .   this place has the best unagi and an awesome escolar ( which i have n't found anywhere else . )   the suprise crazy roll , served with a sweet wasabi sauce , is always on our sushi order . 

 the only con is that this place is pricey , but they do have a daily 5 - 7 happy hour that contains some great options .   however , the best stuff is usually not on the happy hour menu .   also , this is n't a place to have sake bombs .   it 's a very low key atmosphere for those just looking for an excellent meal .   you 'll likely notice early on how many folks are regulars .   i was told this was the spot where many japanese baseball players come to have their sushi . 

 the restaurant is very non - descript .   it sits in a corner of a shopping mall and is easily overshadowed by it 's neighbor c - fu gourmet ."
5,"this hidden gem is located just outside of mill ave and is apparently the hipster home base of tempe . if somehow you are allowed in without suspenders or nonprescription clear glasses , you will see exactly what goes on . to the left at least four people playing chess , to the right someone reading a book , but sitting next to someone writing a book , and did someone just walk in with a puppy ? yes . as you walk up to the counter you are already disoriented so you may be confused about what to order . well , they are known for their cappuccinos , which i can personally vouch for but on a hot summer day in arizona , i recommend their "" dirty horchata "" or "" espresso excellente "" a rice milk horchata with shots of espresso . it was good for the minute it lasted . see you there next time ."
4,"good food , decent selection , open late ( for you partiers ) , decent delivery time ."
5,"i was so happy when i saw this chain appear in az .   i used to frequent it in ca and have never found another sub that comes close .  

 i think the secret to their success lies in the freshness and quality of their meats and cheeses - always sliced to order .   if you are looking for a veggie sandwich - you will be limited here .   but , if you like a hearty cheesesteak or italian sub you are in for a treat .   they also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil & vinegar .    it is a different approach but seriously good !   the "" mike 's way "" option ( lettuce , onions & tomatoes ) is a bit bland , i love to add the mustard , mayo & pepperocini . 

 their signature sandwich is the # 13 .   it has several flavorful italian meats plus freshly sliced cheese .   do n't judge this place until you have tried that sandwich !   it is unlike any other chain 's offering & really amazing .  

 their sandwich sizes are a bit different from the regular foot - long , but if you order the largest size you are getting quite a bit for your money .   i 've visited the one that just opened in chandler and was completely pleased .   and , i 'm happy to hear they are now opening one in ahwatukee . 

 they also seem to have a high focus on customer service - i 've always been met by very cheerful , helpful people .   not a necessity for a sandwich , but certainly a lot better than the opposite ."
4,"from reading previous reviews , times have changed .   the jockstrap has evolved since previous reviews .   this sports authority is # 1 source of sporting goods .   check out the under armour athletic apparel in the mens section , as they have mens trunk underwear that will keep the jingle in your jangle and is as described .   i 've purchased a couple and its evolutionary .   like any retail store , when it comes to pricing you have to be proactive .   to get a break , i check out the wednesday flier that 's in with the junk mail or sunday inserts .   usually you can find some good incentives .   also if you take a couple of minutes to do their invitation online survey you get $ 10 off of $ 50 .   that 's 20 % and if you are willing to succumb your online privacy and give them your email , they will notify you of employee friends and family promotions at 25 % off .   i used it to purchase a $ 399 diamondback that i ended up getting for $ 200 after a sale .   staff are friendly if you ask and if they do n't have a size will do a check to see if another location carries what you are looking for .   i 'm wondering where their puma selection is as i would consider that to be just as popular as addidas .   due to the location it 's my first sports stop , and even though i remember albertsons , the last thing i 'll be thinking about when i 'm there is cottage cheese ."
4,"love their food , great for lunch and breakfast .... 

 the service is a little hit or miss but they always keep your coffee cup full - you will almost always have to ask for extra milk - but whatever . 

 love having the breakfast sandwich or their pancakes - my favorite ones are no longer on the menu though :( they had apples , sour cream and honey over them so good ! 

 not a place for breakfast cocktails though , so do n't anticipate a good bloody mary .    their sandwiches are amazing , i 've had several and have never been disappointed . 

 despite the shoty service it 's a great spot for breakfast or lunch so definitely give it a try ."
3,"as so many others , i found this place because of guy on triple d. the room mate and i made the drive down one afternoon for some lunch hoping that the experience would make the 30 minute drive worth it . i was kind of surprised when we pulled up . from the outside it was n't quite what i was expecting . the place is located in a strip mall and nothing really makes it stand out from the road ... but figured maybe all the awesome was on the inside . 

 we get inside and there are quite a few people . there are n't too many tables and almost all of them were taken . i grabbed the only one available that someone had been recently sitting at and just cleared some of the mess left on the table away . i stepped up to the counter and placed my order for a chicken chimi . it ended up taking a bit longer than i would have expected , but when the food came out it was pretty good . let me say this now , i 'm comparing this place to the filabertos and rudolphos and etc . with that in mind , this place is great . the flavor of the chicken is unlike any you would find at those other locations i mentioned . if you compare it to that of items found at other diamonds in the rough , i think it falls short . it is for that reason i give this place 3 stars . if i lived closer to this place i 'd eat here on a regular basis i 'm sure since the food is not at all bad and the prices are worth it , however i 'm not sure why this place ended up getting a spot on triple d."
3,"i 'd recommend this place highly for two situations :   1 . ) you are on the west side of town and you want some reasonably priced grub , 2 . ) you 've never had vietnamese food and you want to try it out in a non - intimidating environment .   for those two things , pa is awesome !   

 nice people , decent food , and a very friendly environment . but their food does n't stack up to the central phoenix standard bearers . 

 i suppose that their score is artificially low because of the category they are competing in .   were they the only game in town , i suspect i would have rated them much higher - just to get my hands on a bahn mi every now and again ."
4,"the pancakes would be a 5 , but the breakfast burrio would be a 3 and the breakfast torta a 4 so i averaged it out to a 4 star .   a very cute little place and you have to try the pancakes for breakfast .   you can order just 1 if you want , perfect for those of you with something else in mind but still have to try the 5 star highly recommended pancakes ! ! ! !"
5,"kona grill is never a disappointment .   sushi , the regular menu , the atmosphere .....   the staff is very friendly and the food is very good !   we like to create our own sushi dishes and the chef is always ready and willing !   i highly recommend kona grill for consistently good food !"
3,"we ate here last weekend and it was nice .   the wait was long but if you 've never eaten there it 's worth waiting for .   once you get in there you 'll see it 's a fun place to be ; a combination of hip/50 's dinner with real all american food ( especially breakfast ) .   i had the salami and eggs breakfast which was ok .   i thought the salami was way too salty .   the hash browns on the other hand are amazing .   they were made from real potatoes , cooked just right with plenty of grease and i loved every bite !   i also had a cup of coffee that was average at best .   my wife , on the other hand , had a glass of lemonade that was made from scratch and was sweetened with honey which we both thought was awesome .   if you 're going to come here bring a small snack you can munch on outside because the wait could be up to an hour and a half .   best thing is to call before you come and ask how long the wait is ."
1,"this was the most horrible floor cleaning i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! we took before and after pictures and can not tell the difference at all ! the guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job ! i would never recommend this company to anyone . we paid $ 1000 and got $ 20 worth of service . i mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the "" staining as he would say "" off easily . i have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning .... can you read the saying ? that is exctaly how we felt after the service . really ? ! ? ! ?"
5,wow ! the penang curry ( chicken ) was absolutely incredible ! ! the portion was huge ... had enough left over for another meal and tasted just as good the 2nd day . i will definitely be back ! the thai tea was very good also . i just wish it was closer to gilbert !
4,"1 more star awarded : upper crust , you 've grown on me . reading through my previous review , i still have all the same criticisms about the ambiance , but three return trips and i keep finding more and more reasons to like you . 

 * excellent and attentive service , busy or slow 
 * michael david petite petit by the glass 
 * wine wednesday : 1/2 off bottles 
 * great deals through social media 
 * to - die - for yummy crust"
4,"go for the 5 star food and setting , but be warned about the 3 star service .  

 the menu lived up to all the high reviews posted by others .   every dish was inventive and well done .   the salads were particularly noteworthy with the interesting and tasty use of local ingredients .  

 the service was odd .   they were attentive , but amateurish .   it started with a request for a wine recommendation . the wine menu is heavy on arizona wines , which we do n't know anything about .   i do n't think our waiter knew much more than us , and the wine he recommended was barely drinkable .   next we asked a question about the tasting menu .   the answer took some time because , we were told , the waiter was n't allowed to ask the chef directly and had to relay the question through an "" expeditor . "" there were a lot of people helping us , but it was actually too much - it was distracting to have so many different people - and none of them seemed very well trained .   for example , we got our entree and asked about the purée on one plate .   our waiter first guessed celery , and then said it might be cauliflower , and then someone else overheard the discussion and clarified that it was actually potato ."
5,"this go around i opted for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito ( served all day ! ) and lengua ( tongue ) , cabeza ( head , and cheek meat ) , and carnitas ( roasted pork ) tacos .  

 the breakfast burrito was the tastiest , bacon filled treat i have ever had ! i love bacon , and if you do n't love it as much as i do , the bacon overload may be too much , i swear there might be more bacon than egg in this bacon bomb ! 

 i should have figured that with a price of $ 2.50 per taco they would be slightly bigger than the average taqueria taco .   the size of these things are gastronomical , and the flavor of each are equally proportional , the lengua , however ,   would 've probably been better if it had n't been sitting in the cold whilst i ate the other three items ! 

 i will no longer be eating carne asada at this place when i have the option of carnitas , cabeza , lengua , or bacon .   i advise you to do the same !"
5,"this place is pretty incredible .   the california club and the breakfast buzz are probably the best items on the menu imo ... but seriously , you ca n't go wrong .   the only thing i 've had that i did n't really care for is the breakfast burrito , but that was because it was just a little boring compared to the other choices on their menu .   it 's a long wait in the drive thru 99 % of the time , but it is absolutley more than worth it ."
4,"i 'll preface this review by saying that i 've never been a fan of hospitals . my experience with hospitals growing up was always to visit friends or relatives that were sick or recovering from accidents , and i 've never felt 100 % comfortable at the site of blood , dealing with disease , or "" scary "" situations .   for these reasons , i really respect doctors , nurses , and all of the staff that work at hospitals to help those in need on a daily basis . 

 all of that being said , i 've seen my fair share of emergency rooms in the last few years , and for the most part , i 've had decent experiences , even as the patient .   i 've actually been to this scottsdale healthcare location three times already in the past eight months : twice for scares with the pregnancy and once for a breastfeeding class .   this is the hospital where my ob / gyn delivers , so naturally , this is where i 'll be heading when baby mess is ready to enter the world ... and i 'm confident that i 'll be in good hands when the time comes ! 

 i 've heard great things about the facility itself , especially the labor / delivery area , from other friends that have delivered here .   and from my experience to date , the staff has always been great as well .   parking can be tricky , but they do offer complimentary parking during the week ... and the breastfeeding class i took was very informative . 

 bottom line : i do n't think any hospital will ever be at the top of my list of "" fun places to hang - out , "" but if you or someone you know is in a situation where medical help / a hospital is needed , you ca n't go wrong with scottsdale healthcare .   fingers crossed , i 'll still feel this same way after i deliver this baby !"
3,"well look at that . we went to this dunkin on sunday and they did n't mess up our order terribly . i was greeted by the afternoon staff , and they were quite nice . yeah , they could n't get the order right the first time , but they worked with me to make sure they got it right at the window . that 's all i ask for . is that too much to ask ? apparently it is for morning crew . not afternoon . solid , not terrible experience ."
4,"well it 's about time that i yelped about something already , it 's been forever since i have ! 

 got here on my lunch break , and find it surprisingly similar to the mongolian grills that i 've tried back in ca .. piling on the meats , veggies , sauces and such . i 'm a little surprised to hear people review on this place that placing the ingredients in the bowl grosses them out , that 's what a mongolian grill is , right ? oh well .. 

 if you like to customize your food , this is the right place for you , but if you do n't like getting messy with your hands , this is definitely not the place for you . definitely liked the amount of choices in ingredients and sauces , the soup and drink that 's included in the meal .. but the 50 cent charge per to - go box is pretty stupid . staff is really friendly , bathrooms are clean , pretty spacious .... 

 overall it 's decent , but will only come here if i am in the mood for lots of leftovers or willing to fork over $ 9 for lunch .."
4,"johnnie 's garbage dog is the work of the god 's . you ca n't go wrong with any of the dog 's here so when you ca n't make up your mind and everything looks so good - why not just have it all ! seriously try this one . 

 be forewarned it can be messy , so get a good grip because once you pick it up you wo n't be able to put it down ."
4,"all around great .   great food , great atmosphere and great location if you work in the downtown area ."
4,"my take on mill street is that it 's your classic college - town main strip area with a couple bars with big tv 's , a burrito place , a burger place , the quintessential late night grease - craving joint and a couple "" edgy "" "" boutiques "" selling overpriced asian imports to tourists that will bite ( guilty ) , and college students trying to reinvent themselves with "" hippie - chic , "" whatever the f that is . ( um , also guilty ... ) 

 but i way digress ! streets like this also always have a couple more decorous dining establishments for when the parental units are in town -- which is exactly what i happen to have stumbled upon in this place , and perfect because if there 's anything i love as much as edgy "" hippie chic , "" it 's decorum . 

 i treated myself to my one sit - down meal during a week of travel/ being late for everything/ conference bagged lunches , and ca n't think of much more to have asked for than sitting outside on their little street - side patio with my glass of rosé and my truffle oil pizza . granted i 've had better rosé and more perceptive service , but man , truffle oil . self indulgent afternoon success ."
5,"by now you 've heard the adventures at the rustler 's roost ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/rustlers-rooste-phoenix#hrid:_gyib8ea4hdfylss17zc_g ) . but my adventures in phoenix did n't end there . 

 my bgf had been hounding me for days to find some great "" q. "" he was convinced that az would have great "" q "" on every corner . now referring back to the link above , i admit that i had a wee hangover at the time . anyway , i 'll press on . we chose this place because bgf thought that this would be the spot . 

 i ordered the roast garlic chicken and realized with my first bite that i had died ( most likely alcohol poisoning from the night before ) and was now in heaven . this was the best freakin chicken that i ever tasted . of course i 'm in heaven and bgf is grousing about the "" q "" not being any good . 

 now i 've listened to this all week from him . 

 - this q is too spicy 
 - this q is too wet 
 - this q wo n't fall off the bone 
 - this q does n't have the right flavor . 

 i 'll admit it , i snapped . ( and i did n't forgive him for about 2 weeks ) . i went up one side and down the other . if you do n't like the gosh darn ( loosely translated ) q in az , the quit ordering the blankity blank ( translation again ) stuff . needless to say , i got quite the look from bgf and boss . boss was actually laughing at us . 

 anyway , i took pity on my bgf and shared some of my chicken , and he fell in love ( i do n't know why , it was n't a rooster - oops , i digress ) . anyway , it was decided then and there , this is the best chicken around , hands down ."
1,"it is what you would expect from any themed place called "" heart attack grill "" .   mirrors on the bottom part of the bar so you can see up the skimpy outfits the "" nurses "" wear at the bar .   van in the drive through section is painted to look like an ambulance .   hamburgers are named after cardiac events . 

 the food was bad , greasy unlimited fries and a giant hamburger that tasted as if they mixed in filler of some kind we had never experienced before . 

 if you plan on going , enjoy the experience cause the food will not be something you would head back for again ."
4,such good sandwiches ! the meat is cut fresh just as your sammy is made . desserts to die for . plus the family that runs this joint is cute ! yummm !
4,"we just moved to town and were looking for a place exactly like this .   this bar is not posh , it is not shiny or pretty , it does n't have a huge menu ... and that is all fine by me .  

 what it does have is a friendly wait staff , plenty of seating , good / ok live music , and a great bar selection .  

 the mix of people that was there the night we stopped in was entertaining ... i ca n't really comment on that , as i still think everyone here in phoenix is crazy ... lol .  

 either way , it seems to have that good old suburban bar feel to it , which is nice and cozy when you do n't feel like dolling yourself up and having a fancy night out ."
5,"best muffler shop in town . there are very few shops that i trust , and mighty muffler is one of them .   greg has worked on multiple cars and has always done a great job .   if there is ever any issues he takes care of the problem , no questions asked ."
5,"aiello 's is my favorite italian spot in the valley .   in fact , i day dream about the mushroom ravioli special - you can taste the love in this dish .    great ambiance and a wonderful experience .   the staff are always attentive and professional .   the owner makes a stop or two to make sure you 're having a good time and they even let chance decide who pays for dinner , you or the house ! 

 helpful hint :   try no to get stuffed on the tasty bread and hot peppers served before the entree , you 're going to want to finish it !"
4,"one of the best croissants in town , if not # 1 .   i base my rating solely on this and the consistently friendly service ."
5,"this place is a dream .   designer blouses for $ 17.00 .   seven jeans and hudson jeans for $ 20 .   steve madden shoes for $ 25 .   i could go on ... the store is beautiful , well - organized and full of things that are in perfect or near - perfect condition .   some items are still quite pricey , but most of the store is extremely reasonably priced .  

 if you need something new very quickly for a date or an interview or a special occasion , you will probably find it here .   the employees are nice , friendly , helpful and the dressing rooms are good as well .   love it !"
1,"warning : douche bag level code red ! 

 here 's how my experience went ... 

 me : "" may i have a carmel latte ? "" 
 employee : "" no "" 
 .... dead air ... 
 me : "" ummm why not ? "" 
 employee : "" we do n't have carmel "" 
 me : "" ummm i guess i 'll just have a cappuccino then "" 
 employee : "" just so you know it 's a real cappuccino "" 
 me : "" okay "" ( in my head i 'm trying to figure out if i can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not ) . 

 so i sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he 'll be moving to downtown phoenix soon . to which i just chuckled to myself as this person was far from cool enough to blend into cenpho . what a complete and utter douche bag . stay in tempe poser ( and keep your employer there to ! ) . 

 this experience was months ago , and now they have opened up a shop downtown . guess what ? i 'm not going to check them out . fuck you cartel . you 'll never be lux , so just stay in tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you have n't earned . 

 complete fail . 

 for my two cents , skip this place and go to lux in cenpho / mid town right off the light rail . authentically cool with zero attitude , great coffee and no douche bag employees . 

 and as for great coffee ... try conspire way better coffee and authenticly cool . 

 ---- 
 please read "" owners comment "" below ... here 's my response ... 
 ---- 
 wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... i guess my new job   should be to "" promote good coffee in arizona "" ... and i do n't appreciate good coffee because i enjoy the combination of caramel and coffee ... 

 by that definition i guess i do n't know good ice cream because i like hot fudge on it or good pizza because i enjoy pepperoni and cheese or good music if it 's not acoustic or a good voice unless it 's a cappella ... thanks for proving my point . i would n't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... ( i guess ) they do n't need your business you poser !"
3,"great concept my nephews requested i take them there when i was visiting from out of town . we really had a wonderful time , i just wish the staff was a tad bit more friendly for the amount of money we paid for being there . i get it , its annoying explaining how the process works for each person that walks through the door but , i never done this before so i was asking questions .. seemed the employee was a little frustrated which was annoying . but , i stuck it through because that 's what my nephews wanted . other then that this place was fun for adults and the kids . very therapeutic , quiet and allowed your inner creative side to shine through . great amount of colors to work with and supply . i would do it again with them but , hopefully the person at the front desk could smile more often !"
5,"how many great things can one say about the cartel ? does infinity work ! yes , that was a statement , not a question . i am in love with the cc , hands down . i have traded my gold starbucks card in for this amazingly delicious start to my day . the iced coffee ( actually , its toddy , which is better ) is amazing . they roast their own beans , and allow the iced coffee to sit over night , creating an extremely potent concoction . the hot drinks , a+++ as well . and , the food ? a+++++ ( 5 , yup its that legit ) . grab the cheddar bacon muffin ... its literally heaven . no joke . heaven . little clouds may form above your head ; white clouds of course ! not those nasty rain clouds . ok , maybe not clouds . but defiantly your day will be sunny because you stopped into coffee cartel . and not because you live in az . duh . 

 only complaint i have is the hours . i live right next door , and their only open m - f ( like so many places in dt - pho ) . 

 pllleeeeaaaassseeeeee open up for the weekends ! ! ! i 'll work for free ! well ... wait ... i 'll come visit ."

 there is little else that i can say that would more accurately convey my love for this restaurant ."
4,"i always enjoyed coming here after a long night of work . the staff is amazingly friendly and always made my time here great . 

 the sliders are yummy and their appetizer platter they offer is great . you can choose between a variety of different munchies . 

 over all i recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a low key , bar atmosphere ."
4,"i do n't know what else to say that has n't already been said ! i went here for my birthday and it was such a nice and special occasion . having christopher cook for you and talk to you is such a unique dining experience and i was n't disappointed . 

 however ! i would have appreciated being told to have cash up front . also , it got really smokey in the restaurant ( it is so small ) and everyone 's eyes were tearing up towards the end of the meal . 

 i would recommend this place to anyone !"
4,"i will tell you exactly why this place is so great . 

 this place will blow your mind .   not only is the service good , but the food is amazing .  

 here is the rub , your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters _ _ _ _ berto 's .   it does not matter which , they all are basically the same .   you go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10 - 12 hours . talk about regret . do n't do it .   like a child of abuse , you have the power to stop the cycle . 

 say "" nah "" like the famous sunglasses kid , "" let 's go to mi patio and have some fantastic food , amazing service , and keep drinking to boot . ""   you will be a hero . you will make ironman look like aquaman ( he 's a chump .   "" you sir , command that fish into this taco . "" ) . 

 short list of amazing things to be had here : 
 1 . margaritas . 
 2 . mi patio taco . not a taco and not a burrito . what is it ? 
 3 . the chips and salsa 
 4 . chicken tacos .  
 5 .   ice tea . 
 6 . pacifico"
5,"this is an amazing taco truck just minutes from the airport . i ordered the amazing ceviche and a barbacoa burrito , while my girlfriend ordered three tacos . i 've said it before and i 'll say it again here : this truck is an excellent example of the inverse correlation between price and taste in mexican food . eat here before your next flight !"
5,love the pita jungle ! ! !   my fave is the chicken and hummus appetizer .   definitely enough for a meal and super cheap too .   also love the chicken swarma sandwich and the chicken pizza .   you ca n't go wrong here .
5,"a must when you visit the heard .    the staff is very professional .      james , lora and allison are excellent .      the shop is first class .    great place for a collector .       some of the finest native american art available .           highly recommend a visit .        you will be amazed ."
4,"very good food .   our service was great -- thank you , heather .   she guided us to some good wines and food recommendations .   we 'll be back"
5,i love jimmy johns !
4,very tasty .   had the pork which it typically dry but here it was really good .   the only thing is that i got bored with the flavor .   quality of ingredients are very high .
2,"atmosphere good .   food ... not so much .   i recently ate here for the first time and , unfortunately , i ca n't say anything good about the food .   i ordered a chicken shwarma sandwich and expected a hot middle eastern sandwich filled with flavorful chicken sauteed with onions and spices and accompanied with crisp fresh veggies .   what i got was far from what i expected .   the pita bread was your typical crappy faux wendy 's style doughy flat bread ' pita ' , not a regular pita pocket .   inside was some flavorless , cold , unseasoned chicken ( and when i say flavorless i mean indistinguisable from a mouthful of cardboard ) .   they did n't even bother to put basic salt and pepper on this sorry meat .   the remainder of the sandwich consisted of raw zuchinni ( wtf ? ! ) , chopped tomatoes , 3 leaves of romaine lettuce , and some bits of red onion .   none of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned .   oh , there was also some hummus / tahini ' sauce ' mixed in there ( presumably for flavor ) , but i have never tasted anything so flavorless .   i imagine that wall spackle has more flavor and pizazz than this ' sauce ' .   come on paisley , does your cook even taste what comes out of the kitchen ?   add some flavor to your food .   you could start with salt , fresh lemon juice , garlic , pepper , and high quality olive oil .   it 's really not that hard ."
5,"ahhh shady's ... i am a little embarrassed to admit how often i frequent this gem of a place , but definitely not ashamed of how much i love it .   cool atmosphere , just the right lighting ( very important to me ) , great bartenders , good prices on a really nice selection ( who else has old raj gin or agwa de bolivia ? ) .    this is definitely not a dive bar ( not that there 's anything wrong with that ) , but it 's not an icey , blase snobbsdale - ish joint either , and i 've never felt ridiculed or snubbed here either by patron or bartender .   i 've seen all walks of life come through this place , but never felt that it was too ' hip ' or pretentious in any way . great jukebox , obscure , forgotten movies playing on the telly , bartenders that are nice to look at ( male and female ) , have personality and actually remember your name ( and drink ) .   does it get any better than this ?"
5,"i really enjoy this place . it 's beautifully designed . it 's hidden in a historic neighborhood , ( zoning issues so no patio ) , and they make they own tonic ! ---what else does one need ? 

 but now the food . rich , full flavored , comfort food . i do n't think there is a cuisine style here as far as i could tell , just some of the best food around . 

 had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts , awesome . a potato side dish , damn good i tell you . for the main course the skirt steak , which was some of the best red meat i 'm had in a very , very long time . 

 this is my vote for best new restaurant in phoenix . seriously ."
1,"ok so here 's what they teach :   if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself , because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person .   stealing is okay , lying is okay , as long as it is done by you , but for the others , they have no place in society , so pillage and destroy them , it is your right and you will be rewarded for that .   wow ."
2,"when i bought my house , my realtor recommended these guys for the termite inspection .   they found a couple shelter tubes ( old & inactive ) , so i paid them to treat the house and bought a 2 year "" warranty "" .   included in the "" warranty "" is a free annual inspection and any follow - up treatments necessary .   sounded good . 

 first , the good part : the treatment appears to have worked just fine as i have not seen any new evidence of creepy crawlies munching mi casa .   that 's good for three stars , i suppose .  

 but here 's where i have a gripe .   last fall ( 1 yr in to the new house ) , it occurred to me in passing that i 'd been here a year and that i should be expecting some sort of contact from the termite people to schedule the annual inspection .   a call .   a letter .   something saying ' hey , you 're due . '  

 ( i do n't think this is unreasonable to expect from a service - oriented company .   shoot , it 's been well over a decade since i bought my car , and the original dealership still sends me letters saying ' hey , you 're due for your 150k service ! ' ) 

 i hear ... nothing .   and pretty much forget about it .   until ... 

 another year goes by .   i receive a letter from them , "" hey ! your warranty is up for renewal ! "" i do n't recall if the first letter contains ( paraphrased ) "" by the way , we 'd love to schedule your free annual inspection ! "" or if that came in the 2nd letter ... or the 1st or 2nd call .   or maybe it was the 3rd letter and the 3rd call ... 

 it certainly was in the ' hey , your warranty lapsed but if you respond right away we 'll re - instate it for you and schedule your free annual inspection ' letter , though . 

 which , frankly , irritates me .   a lot .  

 i will not be renewing my "" warranty "" with this company as my experience has shown that i 'd be paying for nothing .  

 summary : 

 treatment ? fine . it was effective .   i have no more signs of bugs .  
 service ? awful .   they 'll ignore you unless they want money from you . 
 "" warranty "" ? i 'm not saying it 's a scam , but ... um .... i certainly did not receive any value for the money i paid them ."
5,love it . wish it was in my neighborhood .
4,"during my five - day stay in tempe / phoenix , i honestly did not have a single bad meal .   every restaurant and coffee joint i stopped at gave me great experiences .   i wanted to end my trip out to arizona with a good dinner , and i found myself at dos gringos to hopefully find that last meal out west . 

 honestly , the name sold me pretty quickly .   obviously , i 'm not going to expect fine cuisine and classy dining at a place called dos gringos , but being a fan of dives and being one with my fellow man , it sounded like a good place to experience . 

 despite it being chilly at night now this time of year , it was still an experience upon arrival .   it 's like the tacky , somewhat tasteless , lampooned mexican version of tgi fridays , with a whole bunch of crap all over the walls , and a whole lot of hand - painted placards with sayings that make all of our inner-14-year - olds chuckle and appreciate .   the parking was free and plentiful , and i 'm always a fan of the grungy , christmas lights hanging all over the place kind of decor ; my kind of style for relaxation and no - nonsense . 

 there were tvs everywhere , which was nice to watch some sunday night football in the process , and i sat wherever i pleased .   service was from a cute petite blond waitress who was quick to take my order , deliver my beer , and bring my food when it was ready .   i ordered an enchilada , and two "" street "" tacos , which were corn tortilla apparently .   do n't take my word for it , being an uneducated in mexican food , east coaster , but i thought it was great .   definitely different than the kind of "" mexican "" food i can get in atlanta . 

 overall , i ca n't say that i had a bad experience .   the food was filling , not really expensive , and tasty to my tastebuds .   beer , football on a mild evening in a place full of 56 pieces of tacky mexican flair and a waitress with a great smile , and i ca n't complain .   solid , adequate way to end my dining binging throughout the phoenix / tempe area ."
2,"wow , servers were a bunch of stuck up b 's in corset 's ... that 's original . did n't eat , but wanted to check out the crowd on a friday night .   bleh ... typical nosco crowd of gym jockeys in affliction shirts two sizes too small ... late 40 's women with enough botox to look early 40 's and a few lost 20 somethings stretching to pay $ 12 for a drink .   the cover band made it an easy decision to bail and salvage the night at eddy v 's with some great oysters and live jazz from actual musicians ."
5,dr. koch and his staff are wonderful ! i know that i am in great hands and being given the best care possible . they do a great job at working you in to the schedule if you have a last minute pain that needs some extra attention . i would highly reccomend arizona chiropractic to anyone ! ?
5,wow . best breakfast i had on my recent trip to scottsdale . ordered the eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash . waitress sweet talked the cook into making a side order since they typically do n't do side dishes . that sweet little angel of a waitress made my day ! best corned beef hash ever ! have i mentioned how awesome the waitresses were ? and damn pretty as well . double score .
4,"i 'm in town for business and the guy at the front desk of the hotel recommended this place and it was a definite winner ! 

 drove up , and frankly it 's not in the best neighborhood but the guy in the parking lot keeping watch over the cars in the lot with a "" security "" t shirt on put me at ease . 

 sat down and was welcomed immediately and offered the fresh chips and incredibly hot red and green salsa .   although , i 'm kind of a pansy when it comes to hot and spicy .   i just ate the chips plain and they were wonderful . 

 had the chicken mole enchiladas which were undeniably the best i 've had .   the mole sauce was perfectly made with just the right amount of chocolate .   i have the stains all over my shirt to prove it !   the beans and rice were nice accompaniments .  

 everyone knows the traditional "" mexican "" restaurants where you go in and order the # 13 and they 're all the same right ?   rosita 's place is not this type of eatery .   the food is authentic as authentic comes and should not be missed ."
4,"after a bad experience at a thai restaurant , i swore off eating thai food .   i do n't like spicy food and i was thoroughly convinced that all thai food is spicy ( even if you tell them you want it mild ) . 

 after talking to a colleague , he told me to try lemongrass . he spoke so highly of it that i had to give thai food a another try .   so i did and to my dismay , i loved it .   i checked yelp before going and everyone recommended the thai basil .   that 's what i ordered and i loved it .   i also got the thai iced tea and that was yummy in my tummy sweetness . 

 lemongrass rocks and i will be back ."
4,"no !   the only good dim sum in town , however , yesterday we went and there was a sign on the door that the landlord had shut them down and changed the locks for failure to pay rent ."
3,honey bear 's is no joe 's bbq in gilbert but i actually enjoy it . i usually get the pork sandwich and potato salad and i find myself going here . i like the bbq sauce and the quality of the meat is good . if i 'm in tempe and want bbq i usually go here .
3,"the 3rd star is because they have everything .   and you ca n't beat the prices .   and as far as crowded , budget conscious mega stores , this is definitely on the cleaner side , even with their current renovation project going on . 

 the dark side ...   it is a very crowded mega store , especially at the later hours .   and as crowded as it gets from 9pm-1am , there 's usually only 2 checkers , which makes for long lines .  

 if you can hit this place during a quieter time , earlier mornings or early evenings , then you can get what you need without breaking the bank ."
4,"three stellar write - ups pushed me over the edge and i decided that it was time to take my self for a much needed pedi . when i arrived , the place was packed , but thankfully they gladly take walk - ins and i had only a brief wait before i was whisked away to my massaging , bubbling chair of goodness . 

 i have to echo the other reviewer 's comments on cleanliness and down - right bargain for the service provided . not once did i have that "" eww , you are n't actually going to touch me with that "" reaction . i did n't swoon from toxic vapors as soon as opening the door . and my attendant was super friendly and completely cool with the fact that i had clearly neglected my heals for the last two months ( something that was hugely apparent after she started filing away - how mortifying ... skin flying everywhere ! ! ! ) 

 and for those of you that might fear the elaine experience ( seinfeld reference ) , fret not . you can actually understand everyone one that works here and should n't find yourself sitting and wondering "" what in the hell are they saying about me now ? "" 

 take your twenty - bucks ( plus a little extra for tip - unless you get flowers you will need thirty ) and go get some much deserved pampering . 

 dear paulene - my toes and heals thank you for the love ! -- see pic ; )"
2,"i went here for a business conference .   granted , i just came back from a really nice place in nyc , but i still expected something amazing since it was called the grand resort .   i must agree with fellow yelpers that it seemed a bit outdated .   i did not like the rooms .   there was a baby sink and mirror area .   a bazaar bar in the living room that just did n't seem to fit .   the beds were mediocre .   i did enjoy the kid free pool !   i found it very hard to find my way around this damn place !   i got lost several times :)   i did appreciate their concierge service - very helpful .   i needed a sewing kit to fix a button that came off - $ 7 later , i had one small thing of thread , baby scissors and a needle .   drinks and food were sky high .   we ended up walking down to a little mexican food restaurant nearby .   i do n't think i would go back ..."
5,"nearly 3 years after a waikiki vacation , my longing for a puka dog has been satisfied . maui dog is not exactly the same , nor should it be , but it has the same awesome concept , plus more ! i 've been here twice , once had a beef dog , the other a turkey dog . both with mild garlic mayo & pineapple . these suckers are huge ! and messy ! and delicious ! the dog has good flavor , mixed with the slightly sweet bun , spicy mayo and sweet pineapple ... perfect ! i think it would have been a better eating experience if my order was not to - go . the mess these things make all wrapped up is not pretty , but that absolutely does not deter from the taste . i ca n't wait till i have the time to eat - in and try the rest of their tasty - sounding menu !"
2,"hire a busboy ! i had to say it . i had to take these pictures . this is my _ third _ visit since my may update with the same result and i ca n't keep it to myself any longer . the staff neglects the dining room . period . dot . patrons often have to move dirty plates , stacking them up on top of trays at another table , just to sit down . 

 my recommendation to the owners is to put up some garbage bins like all other self - busing fast - food places and make _ us _ do it if you 're not going to . 

 i have to wonder what happens to all those half - filled salsa squirt bottles left on the tables unrefrigerated for so long . do they top off and return them to service , or are they emptied and washed before refilling ? 

 it is my sincere hope that very soon i will be able to update this review again and say that things are back to normal . until then , i have to advise driving a bit further south to mi patio , or north to sylvia 's la canasta ."
2,"found hair in my burger .   while that is not completely horrible , i was put off by another thing i saw in the restaurant .   they had red buckets of sanitizer sitting on the food preparation counter .   while i like to see a clean restaurant , i do n't think keeping a bucket full of cleaners within a couple inches of the food preparation area is wise .   also the staff was spraying window cleaner on fixtures they were removed for cleaning . this again is a nice thing to see , but not when the overspray was going straight into the food . 

 maybe a one time bad experience , but it just looked like some serious lack of supervision of the staff ."
4,"i 've been eagerly awaiting the opening of this place , since it 's on the way home from work . 

 i finally got the chance to stop by yesterday . they 've been open about a week now . they are located on the north west corner of guadalupe & mcclintock , between the pet food store and panda express . 

 super cute place , has a roll up / fold up door so the whole front of the building can be open , right onto their little patio . you can sit inside or outside ! 

 tons of different flavors ! i tried the peanut butter & jelly & a mint / chocolate one . both were very tasty . i ended up going with their chocolate yogurt with some peanut butter sauce , a giradelli chocolate sauce and peanut butter cups . so good . a decent sized cup cost about $ 3.30 . 

 the girl who rang me up was super nice , and offered me up little sample cups . 

 the only suggestion i have is to label the toppings . yes , most all of them are self - explantory , but a lot of those candy bars look the same all chopped up ! 

 i will be back for sure !"
4,"the shopping center this rack is located in is absolute poison to my pocketbook . tj maxx , ross and nordstrom rack all in a tidy row ? rock on ! 

 there are great deals to be found here with patient and selective hunting like any other discount retailer , and that these great deals are on brands which nordstrom 's carries makes any awesome deal so very much sweeter . 

 do n't go expecting to strike gold at every visit , or expecting ross prices on guess shoes , and you will fall in love with the store ."
5,"i have been coming to this place for atleast 5 years . this is a favorite of my friend 's whole family . 

 this place is so very consistent . they always have the same good things . if you 're looking for buffet variety this is not the place . 

 everyone is so very nice . this place has been open for 30 years for good reason . i have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good . 

 go and try not to get hooked . 

 enjoy !"
1,"so i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place , i would support the first amendment with my wallet . unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least . we came in on a 3 pm on saturday and there was only one other couple inside . we were literally outnumbered by the people working there . i say this because somehow , despite this fact , the service was horrendous . i mean we got our order out fine , but our waitress dissappeared after that . at one point i had to almost get refills for us myself . the sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was . the philadelphia roll was decent , but the california roll was really bad . when it came to paying , i put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile . despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table , the waitress did n't return . if it was n't for the cash i had on me i 'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and i have no intention of ingesting there food ever again !"
4,"fantastic atmosphere . very very friendly staff . food presentation was spot on . 

 we had drinks and a brick oven flatbread ( cheese ) and it was delicious . i ca n't wait to go back and try a full entree . they had a salmon dish on the menu i am going to try when i return . i was staring at other dishes and they looked mouth watering ."
4,"i 'm still a big fan of the light rail ! sure , i ca n't use it every day , but it 's about the only thing that will get me to head to downtown for a night out .  

 it 's perfect for pub crawls , you can gather a huge group , keep everyone more or less together , and make frequent stops .   the extended hours mean more time for drinking ! 

 the trains have stayed clean , they run when they are supposed to , and i 've never had a problem .   the people watching is awesome as well .   each stop is a mystery grab bag of the teeming masses of people here in town . 

 i just wish it had a wider range , i 'd use it every day if i could ."
2,friendly service but food was just ok . maybe an off night .
5,"just as good a pizzeria bianco ! but with the added bonus of not having to wait for hours and hours . granted there may still be a wait here but you are n't fighting tourist for tables at this joint . it 's more of a local fav ! 

 fresh gourmet toppings and very good crust ! personally a big fan of the garden seating ! there was a longer than normal wait for the food however , the server was very attentive and i thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance as we had drinks in garden . i would not recommend this place for a quick meal but it 's perfect if you bring friends and want to have time to relax and enjoy conversation !"
4,"yummy food , friendly old guy - slow , but funny . 

 ca nt go wrong with fried goodness of empanadas here . get the flight of empanadas if you ca nt decide ... the one with cheese and vege is good ! 
 tamales are yums too ! again , get the tamales sampler for a taste of each . 

 everything else on menu is delicious ... and huge portions ! love the plaintains ! ! ! yuca fries ... eat them while they hot ! 

 yes , they take a loooong time , just because if you peak behind in the kitchen , there s only 2 workers ! the old man is trying his best to entertain in the front , while the two in the back are trying to cook as fast as they can ."
1,"after bad experience , i will never return .   it is terrible since they did n't meet my expectation and the price is outrageous .   the most difficult part of the pho is the broth ( req 16 hours of preparation ) and it tasted like water .   i had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but ca n't even eat it .   the restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what i meant with asian restaurant .   if your fellow asians do n't patronize the place , it is   because your food did not meet our expectation .   try across the street to the rice plate kim thanh for their rice dish .   it is night and day ."
1,"was in town for a business meeting and tried to catch a movie with a friend . first impression of the place was that it needed a total make over .   i mean total makeover . walked up to buy my ticket , and the lady was a total jerk ! she had no idea when the movie times were , and she clearly thought we were stupid . she messed up our change , and did n't believe us when we told her . when we walked in they ripped the tickets out of our hands .   when it came time to order our food , the butter on the popcorn tasted like cough syrup . the theater was extremely dirty , and kids were screaming throughout the movie .   after the movie i politely told the manager about our horrible experience .   he was not understanding at all and even threatened to kick us out . i was appaled by this whole endeavor and that is why i am writing this review . it was a complete waste of time and money and i recommend everyone to stay away ."
5,"simply amazing !   we love it ! 

 my hubby and i stopped in one day after deciding not to go to nypd . 
 they were next door , and we thought lets try something new . we have been there 3 times since . you sit , and the food comes by and you just grab what you want off the rotating bar . its great ! especially if you can not decide what you want until seeing it . we ate like king and queen for $ 20.00 . 

 they have simple pricing , and it is affordable for a date or family ."
4,"i have gone here several times and have tried the pizza , subs and the calzones .   i have not had anything there that i did not like and the only reason i do n't give this five stars is because everytime i am in there it seems a large group with lots of young kids has just sat down ( or come to run around me while i try to eat ) at the same time as my date and i.   i admit , i wish restaurants had sections for families so that those who do not like watching kids run around or spitting food out of their mouths on to the table could eat in peace , but that is just me and that is why i have dogs and not children . 

 anyway , this place has awesome food , good service and if you can handle large groups of families then i highly recommend you take the drive out here to give it a try ."
4,"okay so the only reason i 'm giving rigoberto 's 4 out of 5 stars is because i 'm currently on a diet and it 's not diet friendly . so i 'll write the rest of the review based on my pre - diet dining . 

 this place is some serious mexican food . not the fancy stuff , the good , mexican - at - home style . it 's good at 6 am , lunch , dinner , midnight , and even the 2 am drunk - i'm - hungry meal . i have three favorites here . 

 1 . bean and cheese burrito w / sour cream - the beans are refried with good ol' grease . it 's delicious and the cheese is legit cheddar . 

 2 . super nachos - i do n't understand how you can not finish this one . they give you a ridiculous amount of chips with a mexican buffet on top , but once you get the hot sauce on it , you ca n't stop . 

 3 . carne asada burrito , no pico , with sour cream and guacamole - cooked fresh on the grill and wrapped in the biggest tastiest flour tortilla . they even will sell you the tortillas by themselves if you ask . 

 enjoy !"
5,"all i have to say is get the california club . i live in the east coast and i still crave for the sandwich . i wish i had the chance to try other things on the menu . the drive - thru concept is pretty neat , but there was a bit of a wait . guess you ca n't rush perfection ."
4,"eaten here a few times ( 7th street - coronado district ) . i can say the place is small but has a cozy feel to it . it 's an old converted house to restaurant . 

 the food is a little pricey considering the portions are not huge ( like filiberto 's or carolina 's ( extra yummy ) . but the food was decent . 

 i 've eaten the vampiro , carne asada burrito , chips n guac / salsa , and america 's corn ( yummy ! ! ) . my eyes are always bigger than my stomach :) .   i will say that the last time i did get the corn , it was a little under - cooked . so it was a little harder to chew ... but regardless , it was still good . smothered with mayo , butter , and cojita cheese i think ... how can you go wrong with all of that yummy - ness ! ! 

 i would visit this place again , if i am down in that area . they also allow you to order online which i think is cool because that line gets very long very quick ."
5,"great pizza . great service . 

 we 've been here a few times since it opened . and always look forward to going . we have never had a bad experience . each time has been great . our waiter dave was perfect , always on the ball ."
4,"this place has great food - some of the best "" bar "" food around . but you really go for the beer . it 's a brewery , right ? 

 i have n't tried a beer i did n't like here . there should be one that fits your taste , even if you 're not a big beer drinker . the prices are reasonable and even better during happy hour which has two convenient times during the day ( regular and reverse ) . if you 're unfamiliar with the beer choices try a sampler and then grab a pint of your favorite !"
4,"neat ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 

 this place is like a trip to a non - petting zoo and aquarium and aviary while you dine on fairly decent mexican food .   i was here for a late brunch and did n't wait at all .   i was near a window that right on the pond , and just about every turtle in the pond crawled out to come on over and see what the rock was cooking and how i was enjoying it ... no joke , see pic ! 

 the ducks and geese were very active in the lagoon , showing off for all the diners , and it thrilled the kids to pieces .   the guacamole is decent and the 3 types of salsa you 're given were all good in their own ways .  

 if anything , swing in here for the atmosphere .   i bet its awesome at night ."
5,"i love the fish tacos from rubios , i always order them . well sometimes i get the shrimp or salmon tacos and i also love that black salsa chipotle sauce and the chips are delish here ."
3,"i 've been to happy hour here on a few occasions now and i have to say that i 'm becoming more and more fond of geisha . the prices are pretty decent , but what really makes this a great happy hour place is the ambience - it 's lively and fun ! 

 happy hour is 4p - 7p every day and is half off sake bombs , appetizers , house sushi rolls ... and i just realized specialty drinks as well ! i need to go back so i can try the hello kitty and harajuku lover specialty drinks ! both look delicious . 

 not the most amazing sushi and appetizers , but definitely not bad considering the price . and for me during happy hour anyway , it 's really more about the company and drinks than the food . 

 happy happy hour hopping !"
5,"i always forget about this place when we do a party . they carry costumes and party gear year round ... even halloween stuff . 

 stopped in today to look for a flintstones costume but they had no fred 's and the wilma they had for 50 bucks , we bought on - line for 30 bucks . i had an online coupon for 15 bucks so i only bought house decor for halloween . but if you need any kind of prop for a costume / theme party , bike pub ride , or just feel like dressing up , this place is perfect !"
4,"i 've been to this place three times and have enjoyed it every time .   the service has been good .   no complaints . 

 we really like the thin crust pizza 's .   and the salads have been big and tasty .   spliting one small pizza and a salad with my wife if plenty for us . 

 we 've also had the lunch special of a large slice of pizza and a salad .   just the right amount of food and tasty . 

 my wife and i think the prices seem fair for the good quality of the food . 

 this is now our first choice for pizza , since we are n't going to drive all the way downtown and wait two hours at chris biancos every time we want pizza ."
4,"i stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new . the place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve . he clearly explained every item i was curious about since the labels were in spanish . i asked if his name was miguel and he said yes . i told him i read about his bakery on yelp . then he said that he loves yelp and that 's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places . he was very friendly and had lots of patience . i was the only customer at the time and he actually does n't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others . i ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $ 6.80 . what a great deal ! 


 they also sell other items such as tamales , burritos , and menudo . i inquired about the burritos cuz i like mine with a little kick , but unfortunately they were n't ready yet . he showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos . he said they do n't look big , but he assured that the burritos are filled with red ( mild ) or green ( with a kick ) chili , shredded pork , and some potatoes . he said that one burrito is good to fill up a person . so ... i must come back and try it . 


 so far i 've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and bavarian cream ... the bavarian was n't as creamy than i 'm used to . i almost thought it would have been better off to not have it , but it 's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the bavarian on its on . 


 i had that curvy , pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top , i thought it might be too sweet , but nope . it was just fine with the pineapple filling ( excuse me as i wipe my drool ) . 


 then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar . the first bite was eh . the second bite was ... um . third bite , wow ! i finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and i love it ! ! ! did i mention that i 'm not a big fan of caramel ? this caramel is sweet and creamy . it 's just so good ! a definitely must have for next time . 

 that 's about as much my tummy let me eat for today . i 'm sure the rest will be just as good and i ca n't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies ."
5,"this ice has the abilty to make you feel cold on a 100 + degree day - i am hooked on the key lime , alex 's lemonade , and florida orange . very nice staff , friendly and free samples ...."
4,"their happy hour is crazy cheap ! ! ! 

 the scene though is like a poor mans rehab / wet republic , but i 'm not mad ! it gets really crackin there especially on the weekends ( suffice to say , i was only there for a weekend hahaha ) . this is definitely a spot to checkout while in scottsdale !"
5,"i love this mall . you need a giant mall like this when it is 120 degrees outside ! it is one of the only indoor malls that i like . i feel so calm when i am here . you can find just about anything in this mall .   the food court is pretty good .   i like paradise cafe for sandwiches .   there are sit down restaurants and a movie theater inside as well .   plenty of parking or you can just valet .   my favorite nordstroms is here .   i find the nordies in sf to be too big and overwhelming .   the one at the fashion square is minimalist , well organized , and edited to suit my tastes ."
5,"if you are writing poor reviews you obviously have not eaten susie 's chile verde con carne .    i dream about it .   and i grew up in new mexico !   the best   bowl of green chili stew or even better the green enchiladas with melt - in - your - mouth beef anywhere in town .   # 13 ... don't forget the sour cream .   

 so you with the 2 & 3 stars go back and try the green chili and watch your stars become shooting stars !   i 've never tried anything else there .   why would you when you 've found green chili heaven ? man , just talking about it makes me drool .   i 'm headed out the door ..... susie 's here i come !"
5,"amazing . just stopped for snacks , had the fake crab rangoons and samosas . very good . will mos def come back to dine , hopefully several times , when in town . 

 love that they sell diaya in the cooler and other lovely products , books and junk foods !"
2,"where do i begin ? 

 let 's start with the server who literally yelled everything he asked or said to us . oh , and then he rammed a chair into my leg and was just not very concerned about our experience overall . 

 let 's move on to the cheese crisp , which had plenty of grease cascading off the pieces , and virtually no "" crisp . "" did you put some cheese on a tortilla and microwave it ? 'cause i could have done that at home . 

 both drinks were quite tasty- my tea was strong like i like it , but not bitter . hubby 's lemonade was very good , but he drank it so fast i did n't get a chance to steal many sips . 

 let 's discuss the entrees , shall we ? hubby 's carne adovada chimi was decent , better than my carnitas . in fact , my carnitas is better . ( i keep aiming for chef hector 's at sam 's ... ) yes , the pork was very tender , but the salt was -shall i put it nicely?- aggressive . sam kinneson aggressive . the "" tortilla "" was an inedible science experiment . thick and doughy , and made even more appetizing by the charred side , it reminded me of the salt play dough we all made as kids , formed into a pancake . truly nasty . 

 as for the legendary salsas , hubby found the green to be tasty , but he did not care for the flavor of the red . neither was especially fiery to him either . 

 riding on reputation , are we ?"
4,"i 've been here for dinner and the food was pretty tasty . the mixed grill platter is a definite recommendation , and the chicken biryani was full of flavor . the only downside was that the naan was just ok . not straight out of a tandoor like naans should be . 

 their weekend brunch was decent but kind of disappointing . the chicken tikkas were kind of bland and there were no fresh puris to go along with the channa and halwa . 

 but all in all , a good tasty experience and definitely one of the better indopak restaurants in the valley ."
3,"we ( my husband , 2 friends and i ) visited tavola last night because of a yelp review . we were n't as enthusiastic . the service was great ! we ordered 2 pizza 's and 2 salads . the salads were fresh , that was a nice surprise , not bagged . the pizza was good . crust was a thicker than we like . not a bad experience at all just not quite what we expected after the 5 stars ."
3,"ok , stingray has it 's high points . it 's trendy , hip , and might just explode with young , beautiful people . the atmosphere and decor are nice , but that does n't completely make up for the fact that the sushi simply falls around the mean . it 's average . the menu has a nice selection of rolls and other dishes , and they 're good , just not ... great . we had a couple different specialty rolls , a tofu dish , soft shell crab , and tempura . overall it was fresh and well - presented and halfway between actually authentic japanese and some american asian fusion food . the bar is crowded if you grab drinks while waiting and the bartenders were n't really fabulous in any way . same goes for the servers who lack attentiveness and decorum in general . for a place with such a wait , huge crowds , and pretentious hostesses , i 'd expect a little more . the curved booths along the sides are nice , though . oh and , beware , in regards to the well - earned and deserved "" scene "" : you might just see / run into every person you want ( and do n't want ) to on a saturday night ."
4,"if only they had a place like tryst cafe back in california ! the first and only problem i had with the place was the fact that i wanted nearly everything on the menu . they have amazing specials , and while the monte cristo breakfast sandwich and glazed - walnut french toast looked amazing , i was hungry and opted for the hawaiian breakfast . 

 the food came pretty quickly and was warm . we did n't order any drinks because the fresh - squeezed one 's are so expensive it 's actually cheaper to buy one of their smoothies . the hawaain special- composed of 2 fried eggs , shredded kalua pork , cabbage and rice- was tasty , but a little bland . they gave my brother and i ( we ordered the same thing ) some soy sauce , but i would have preferred a nice dollop of ketchup instead of the sodium infested kikkoman . other than that , the dish was delicious . they fried the eggs perfectly , the runny yolk making the rice and pork taste even better ! i usually only like my eggs over - hard , so it was a pleasant surprise . 

 my mom opted for the healthy option , getting the yogurt parfait . in my opinion , this was the disappointment of the table . my mom claimed that she loved it and that it tasted like beijing 's yogurt . my mom must have some really refined tastebuds because all i tastes was some store bought low - fat vanilla . the granola was good and the berries fresh and few . what can you expect for $ 5 ? in my opinion , a little better than that . my dad , opting for the unhealthy option got the huevos rancheros . he ate it so quickly i did n't get a taste , so i can only assume it was tasty . 

 overall ? great choices , great venue , and good food ."
4,"from the get - go we liked this place .   the fried dumplings were wonderful and crispy on one side and lovely and soft on the other and the dumpling sauce was amazing and just spicy enough .   my husband refused to let it go and finished it over the course of our meal ! 

 on this , our first trip , we had tangerine beef and the crispy duck .   the tangerine beef sauce was sweet and a bit tangy with a touch of spice and the beef was crispy and very tasty .   the duck was amazing .   the tastes were multilayered and well balanced and the crispy coating was salty and peppery and almost buttery under it all .   together it created a very complex savory and sweet dish with a kick of spice at the tail end .   the flavors in the duck were very reminiscent of cantonese food in shanghai ... this is the first time i can say this about a restaurant in the states that is n't located in a chinatown . 

 the wait staff was friendly and very helpful , welcoming us back and giving information on some local asian markets as we left .   i highly recommend this place !"
4,"back in august we went on a sat night .. we got our ' skate on ' good ! 
  8 bucks total ( but i have my own skates ) 2 dollar skate rental ( i think ) 

 great dj was spinning classics .. i love roller -disco .totally took me back to my disco days .. also played a great mix of music in general . 

 it was super fun . 
 place needs some sprucing up ... but it would n't stop me from returning , especially for some old school fun ."
5,"of course it gets hot in the summer . you 're going to be watching bands in a basement with a bunch of people and depending on when / what 's going on there might be some idiots ' mawshing ' . 

 sound quality is great for the size . glad they reopened one of my favorite venues . and yes everybody has gotten lost the first time they tried to find the nile . the main & front room have shows as well ."
5,"seriously soo good ! drove 60miles to come here about 5 times in the 3 months that i lived in az . 

 i came here because of the triple d episode and it was soo worth it ! burgers , fries , onion rings , sweet potatoe fries and pizza are all good ! 
 and check out their bathrooms .. its pretty cool too . 

 tried joe 's real bbq , which is their first restaurant but it was just ok . 
 joe 's farm grill is def . one of my fav places .."
3,"not the best burger i 've ever had , but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a friday afternoon . i had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all - you - can - eat fry station . better than bk / mcd 's , but nothing to write home about . the waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair ! but it 's more of an attraction than anything else ."
3,"this was the first and only thai place i 've been to in az .   overall , it is pretty good .   i think we will probably try a new place next time but if we ca n't find anything better , i think we wo n't have any problem going back to swaddee . 

 * price = on the high - end 
 * pad thai = pretty good volume 
 * green curry = very good . 
 * garlic delight = the portion is way too small to charge $ 11"
4,i was so excited to visit the new postino in gilbert ! ! ! i love and frequent the original but this new location is much closer to my house . bruschetta is amazing ! ! ! love the atmosphere and staff too . wine selection rocks ! ! ! great happy hour prices ! ! ! highly recommend a visit !
5,i love this theater ! ! it 's 100 % digital and very clean and the staff is friendly . i believe that the have child care if you have any . also lot 's of great restaurants and shopping all within walking distance in the shops @ norterra .
1,"slow , unorganized and filled to the brim with crazy people . i prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recently got a letter that i needed to get a new license because my picture was going to expire . it makes total sense that my license is valid until i 'm 65 but the picture expires after 11 years . of course , the state charges a nominal fee of $ 12 to replace it . if the state of az was in need of my money i 'd gladly just give it to them if it means avoiding this nightmare . oh , and the camera is set to fat ..."

 ( full disclosure : i do n't like sake ) 

 parents in scottsdale for a first look at the new house / neighborhood . we were on the horns of a dilemma : ? would a mid week , early season dinner at the club be too quiet ? should we   descend south of   the frank loyd wright   into south - north scottsdale .... ? ? 

 we opted for the safe bet - booked a car and headed south to the ocean club . 

 * * a ) never drink and drive in scottsdale ( or anywhere else for that matter ) 

 * * b ) if you 're a foreigner - never- ever drink and drive in scottsdale 

 * * c ) a + b refer to you nikolai khabibulin 


 ( ( a nod of support to the yelp community . after perusing the ocean club reviews retrospectively i believe the correlation existing between the posted notes and reality to be around 0.90 well done ! ! 
 ( i would go as high as a correlation of 0.95 if high and low marks were thrown out ( similar to olympic skating or gymnastics ) ) ) 


 we arrived at the club---- a good bar crowd ( not quite as mountain lioness(y ) as i had expected ( ? hoped ? ) -- ? mid week perhaps ... ? , 
 a good blend of hipsters , hobos and mrs lovey howell iii 's

 we were promptly seated - at a good table - well positioned , near the back and partially curtained - nice . 

 ( score + 1 for the ocean club ) 

 the waiter then promptly arrived to take our drink orders : 

 now - i do n't like sake ( see note above ) - but on occasion - i like to fancy myself as the kind of guy who may indeed like sake- hence , i order a grey goose sake martini - 

 "" i have no sake "" the waiter announces sadly . 
 now - this is tricky - can i in good conscience penalize the establishment for not having a beverage that i really do n't like or want in the first place ? 

 too bad for you ocean club 'cause yes i can . 

 ( score -1 for the ocean club ) 

 the drinks arrive - i have opted for grey goose sans sake 
 and yes -sweet jesus   they are huge ( see prior posts ) .

 the waiter then arrives to review the menu and describe the specials- 
 this he does without note , blackboard , evening card or inked cheat note on his wrist- 

 he recites for what seems to be forever ... 
 it is like a reading from the old testament - but instead of a mere chapter of the book of leviticus - he recites the entire book .... 
 i am captivated .... ( or is it the grey goose ) 

 ? ? does he really know the name of the italian girl who dug this evenings truffles up in piedmont ... ? ? 

 ? ? does he really know the glove size of the japanese ranch worker who massaged the wagyu beef and from which prefecture he hailed ... ? ?

3,met up with a group of friends here on a monday night ... a big group . although keegan 's had no notice of our mob arrival they did well with service etc . beers were poured fast ; food took a little extra time but with a group our size that is to be expected . the outside patio space was great on a warm az night ... a friend got the sliders and said they were quite tasty when they finally arrived . the happy hour prices are okay with a nice choice of beers and mixed cocktails .
4,"great place for tapas ! i really enjoy this restaurant for a couple reasons . 1 being that they change the menu constantly and 2 being that each item on the menu is always good . some are better than others , but the worst thing on their menu is good . 

 i love going with 2 or 3 other people so we can order a variety of things and i can try new and different kinds of food . sol y sombra is always a nice change of pace from other scottsdale eateries . 

 nice cocktail and wine list also ."
3,"anything with the word "" original "" in that name always makes me wonder , for real ? 

 this place is for real . it is very close to the new house and i met the ' rents there for a burger the other night and to watch the giants beat the ' 9ers . i immediately felt a sense of familiarity when i walked in the door , i had n't remembered being there before until i walked in . but it all came back to me very quickly . i remember stopping by here years ago with friend before heading to the fair one year . it was just as good as i remember it . 

 it is an old fashioned burger join . you can either walk up and order then take your food to your table , or if you are on the bar side you can order from the bartender , who is very attentive , even with a full bar and restaurant . once you get your burger or sandwich , you go to the fixin 's bar , load up on toppings and veggies then sit back down to enjoy ! they also have some great sides and aps , fried mushrooms , onion rings , zucchini and fries . they fries are ok , a little over done for my taste but everything else was great . 

 this is a great place to make a regular stop on your weekly happy hour agenda , to watch a sports game ( tons of tvs on the bar side ) or to fix your burger cravings ."
2,"maybe i 'm ordering the wrong stuff , but i 've * always * been disappointed in the grub at 5&diner ... the service was stellar and i really do like the ability to dine al - fresco at 3 am , but does everything need to be soaked in butter flavored crisco ? ? ? ughghg ."
2,"service was s l o w. toook a l o n g time for someone to greet us and when they did only dropped off menus . wait . wait . we ordered beverages and food at same time . things showed up one by one ... 

 i ordered the spicy basil which was very flavorful and i thought was the best tasting of the 3 entrees ."
1,my daughter and i went in for pedicures and gel sets ... was incredibly surprised to hear the total was $ 120 . even with a coupon ! ! ! when i got home i noticed that my pedicure was n't the best ... i really do n't mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a ' coupon ' it was n't worth it . wo n't be back ...
5,"this place was great . when one of my coworkers sent an email to our group who was visiting phoenix saying he had gotten us a reservation at "" the best pizza in the country "" i was skeptical . best pizza in phoenix ? well , i was n't disappointed ! 

 we had a group of 8 . , and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu : 
 apps : 
 antipasto - wood roasted vegetables , sopressata , bite of cheese 
 spiedini - italian fontina wrapped in prosciutto di parma , served warm 
 pizza : 
 margherita - tomato sauce , fresh mozzarella , basil 
 marinara - tomato sauce , oregano , garlic ( no cheese ) 
 rosa - red onion , parmigiano reggiano , rosemary , az pistachios 
 sonny boy - tomato sauce , fresh mozzarella , salami , gaeta olives 
 biancoverde - fresh mozzarella , parmigiano reggiano , ricotta , arugula 
 wiseguy - wood roasted onion , house smoked mozzarella , fennel sausage 

 of all of them , the biancoverde was my absolute favorite ! i do n't eat pork , so i could n't sample them all , but i 'd happily order this one again . in fact , my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming phoenix trip , and i will for sure be ordering this . 

 their house draft beer is also quite tasty ! 

 tip - if you are a party of 6 - 10 , get a reservation ! they do n't take reservations for smaller groups and i 've heard the wait time can be a few hours at the busiest times ! but worth it !"
1,"my love affair with fate ended when johnny left . 

 the service , quality and atmosphere took a total nose dive . 

 go to sens instead ."
3,"my husband and i tried this place out since it is fairly close to our house and gets decent reviews .   i drank , my husband ate .   the wine selection is ok and the staff seemed friendly .   my husband 's dinner was okay .   i 'd probably give this place better reviews had they not attempted to give themselves a $ 15 bump on their tip .   i 'd also probably give them better reviews if the manager would have called me back after leaving a message with a staff member about the charge especially when i left all the details necessary to fix the issue and was promised a call back that afternoon when the manager arrived .   now , i can only assume it was not an inadvertent mistake since they give me no reason to believe otherwise .   i really would rather not have to keep calling back and chase my $ $ down . 

 edited review - took them from 1 star to 3 stars since i received a phone call today from a manager and was advised it was a mistake and they credited me back the funds .   also will be sending me a gift card for the trouble .   overall , i appreciate the follow up and their efforts to fix the issue and bring me back in .   i was routing for them since the patio seems like a pretty chill place to have some drinks and unwind ."
2,"not so good anymore . plus the "" aura "" of the place has become a little snotty ."
2,"place is avg .   sushi was good but the red sangria saki was bad . service was sporadic and we had a one plate that they forgot to put the sauce on , and another couple plates they tried to give us which we did not order .    i would try to find another place ."
2,"as a breakfast snob i really do not like denny 's .   they do n't really do anything especially well .   also , i 've had inconsistent quality of food and helpfulness of staff on different occasions .   i ca n't slam this place for one unpleasant waitress , but i can for those inconsistencies and that fact that there are just so many other places that do what they do better . 

 in fact , this place was the very last denny 's i ever ate .   the food took forever , it was n't well done , came out all screwed up , and the waitress was unpleasant .   after that experience i decided to never set foot in another denny 's ."
5,"what an amazing place ! !   i had an incredibly enjoyable time staying at the royal palms resort , and recommend it highly .   so many excellent points :   absolutely gorgeous accommodations , polite and helpful staff , excellent restaurant ( breakfast/ brunch outside , with a delicious cup of coffee , is a must ) , a great spa , and a relaxing atmosphere .   my boyfriend and i stayed here for a conference in late october , which is a great season in arizona .   our stay was a pleasure from beginning to end .   the resort is well - suited for special occasions ( there was a wedding reception and an outdoor conference dinner during our stay ) .   our room was very comfortable , with excellent set - up and a great view of the mountains from the balcony .   the resort includes a pool , a small gym , several lounge areas with firepits and fireplaces , and the wonderful alvadora spa ( with massages , facials , outdoor - facing showers , and shaded lounge areas to your heart 's content ) .   there are several mountain trails a short walk/ drive away from the resort , and downtown scottsdale is 10 - 15 minutes away by car .   in all , a beautiful place for a special occasion !"
5,"can i review some of the people who go here ? because i know one idiot who would get 1 star .   ( but the park still gets a 5 ) 

 one dude let his dog pee on me ! and the little bugger was fast ! he 'd prance toward you , and before you knew it , his leg was up and piss was streaming out of his winky cannon ! 

 my friend was tinkled on multiple times ; she was n't able to jump out of the way very quickly since she was pregnant . did the man say anything ? only that his dog was only nervous . are you kidding me ? 

 alright , i got your number . in return , we very actively encouraged our australian shepherd to play with the little terrier . why ? because the aussie shep becomes a drool monster at the dog park , and the little pissing terrier ( who only likes to pee on people , not trees or anywhere else in the park ) ended up dripping the aussie shep 's saliva . sweet ! ( that was the only time we did n't feel guilty about her saliva marking other dogs ) ."
4,"this was a nice casino experience .   it was n't as loud as las vegas .   the food was really greasy and made me a bit sick .   admittedly , i chose to eat at the fast food place inside the casino , but ah well .   i still had a great time .   i do n't really gamble , so i only came out $ 10 ahead , but it was still fun ."
3,"zipps has good bar food , but the service is usually horrible . the waitresses rarely come to your table . but , what really rubs me the wrong way is this .... 
 on multiple occasions , when i pay the bill , the waiter does n't bring me back the correct change . even if my change is 1 cent , i 'm entitled to receive my money back . 
 i 'm sorry , but not giving me back my   change because you deem it insignificant does n't float well with me . they do have great food though ."
3,"we have been using delia 's cleaners now for nearly three years and for the most part found the experience to be very good .  

 yes , like most cleaners they goof from time to time ( like sometimes killing the button - downs on my dress shirts ) .   but , here 's the difference -- they 'll fix them for no charge .   yep .   just ask , the staff is very helpful !"
5,"if i could give it more than 5 , i would .   sweet pea and i live down the street , literally down the street , from this bar .   we waited for it to open for what seemed like decades , praying that this was going to be the type of place that could become our local .   it has exceeded our expectations .   the atmosphere is amazing .   the drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best i 've ever had .   they tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside .   margarita mondays- $ 4 margs and free food ?   happy hours are amazing .   new year 's eve last year was amazing .   the 1 year anniversary party was amazing .   but most of all , the owner and staff are some of the coolest peeps that you 'll ever meet .   go here .   you will love it ."
5,"simply put this place is awesome .   if you 're looking to start a business or already own a business but need some of the details on a particular area , this is the place to be .   so far i 've only attended a brown bag lunch but i was thoroughly impressed by the people who were there . however , do n't show up with out being ready to put in your two cents , its needed to keep the ball going , i thought it was really good .   i ca n't wait to go back !"
3,"i have never actually been to a pawn shop for any reason . i ca n't honestly even tell you what they are used for . i have never seen pawn stars . i do n't watch television .

4,"this review is slightly bias , seeing that i was in the press box . this park is very nice . has ample parking and a ton of restaurants in the area for before or after the games . the food in the stadium is typical overpriced stadium food . i had the chicken teriyaki bowl for $ 7 . the vendors are comical ( you will hear the lemonade guy from across the stadium ) . i 'd definitely see another game here in the future ."
4,"three words : thai . tuna . roll . 
 get it . you wo n't be disappointed .  

 in addition , the california and the mango salmon rolls were quite good as well .   while arizona is n't a place known for stand - out sushi , i 'd order it here again .   and in fact i did ... two nights in a row . 

 night # 1 - the bartender was a superb professional . he replaced drink napkins when they were damp and even poured my martini into a fresh cold glass when i was half - way done .   class act .   he was also the one who recommended the thai tuna roll which adds even more points to his score , if possible .  

 night # 2 - cranky bartender . while she recommended a nice glass of white wine , she poured me a totally different one the second time .   while it was st patrick 's day , it 's not like this place was packed out with annoying patrons so i 'm not sure what put her in such a bad place . it did leave me with a not - so - happy feeling when i left , despite the fact that the food was just as good as the first go - around .  

 so , what could be the only gripes aside from the attitude ?  
 * you will pay a chunk of change for your meal here ( but it will likely be worth it ) 
 * you will also likely order something that they 're out of ( mango salmon roll the first night , grilled artichoke the second night , and every night i 've ever gone to a hillstone , for that matter ) 
 * it 's a chain 

 bottom line is that hillstone is probably one of the better options in this neck of the woods .   go for a cocktail and a thai tuna roll , if nothing else ."
4,"love this place ! nestled in the side of the mountain , the four seasons is what you would expect from their properties . smiling and friendly faces , exceptional service , a beautiful pool area and an atmosphere to help you relax . 
 while both the restaurant and banquet food was good , it was not 5 star . for these prices , it should be . do n't get me wrong , it was very good . just not great . the lobby bar , onyx , is small but get 's hopping and is a welcome retreat from relaxation when you need some fun strangers to talk with . 
 having stayed here twice and visiting friends for cocktails on their patios , i can tell you the rooms varied greatly from huge to average in size . some with lap pools and patios while others had private decks up against the hills . 
 the wonderful smell of chiminea burning along the paths add to a delightful get - a - way . i highly suggest this resort if you are in the mood to relax . it 's not near much so you wo n't be tempted to do anything . and that 's my idea of a vacation ."
3,"oh , sushi brokers ... what happened to you ? ! this used to be my go - to place for great ambience and delish sushi .   we ate there friday night for the first time in a long time and they have significantly raised their prices and the sushi was subpar at best ! $ 90 for 3 rolls and 3 cocktails . grrrr .... frustrating !"
5,"this place is a bit difficult to find granted but well worth the effort . if you 're shopping down at the farmer 's market , need a place to study , or just want to plop down with a good book , fair trade will caffeinate you as well as   feed you such tasties as quiches , stuffed croissants , cookies , bagels , and sandwiches .  

 the cafe was run by the church up until julyish in answer to mr. k 's musing but they 've been bought by a few of the regular customers and are enjoying a slow but steady revitalization along with a steady extension of hours .   they 're also hopefully expanding they 're menus to include more food food items as volume picks up . 

 additionally , they offer only fair trade coffee and teas so you can do your part to help fair trade just by sipping at a cup of coffee ."
5,"these are absolutely my favorite donuts in the whole wide world ! ! ! no offense to those krispy kreme lovers out there but i think lamar 's has them beat ! 

 their donuts are always so fresh and delicious ! my absolute favorite is the chocolate iced cake donut with m&m 's . just thinking about them is making me salivate ! ; - ) ! ! 

 i suggest getting there earlier rather than later because sometimes they sell out of certain varieties ."
4,"i was a little skeptical when a coworker followed our bosses recommendation of   this place for lunch last week ; what does a suit know about mexican food ? 

 our party of 3 arrived at 1145 , a tricky time for friday lunch . we were promptly seated to a clean table and i noticed the other tables were also getting cleaned quickly . having worked in the industry for several years , i notice this sort of stuff and appreciate a quickly bussed dining room . 

 most of the staff are spanish speaking but my gringo lunch pals had no problem getting by with their spanglish and innocent , pleading looks . 

 i scanned the menu and quickly spotted the "" home make corn tortillas "" for the quesadillas . i asked the server and she confirmed that this was only for the estilo del rey quesadillas . i 'm a sucker for anything made in house- sign me up ! she also guided me away from the pork and told me to get the chicken because it was better . i love having an interaction with someone who actually knows what they 're talking about , so much better than a doe - eyed or aloof server saying "" everything is good "" . 

 when my plate arrived , i was really impressed with the presentation . the quesadilla took up half the plate , it was drizzled with crema , sprinkled with queso fresco , fresh cilantro and diced onion . it was served with a side of shredded iceberg and some lime wedges . i 'm a firm believer in meaningful condiments , so if it comes with wedges dammit i 'm using all of them . 

 i juiced the limes and went to town . the steaming hot shredded chicken was perfectly cooked , sauteed with onions , spices and dressed with just the right amount of red chili . slight warning- this is a little spicy but i would rate it close to a valentino or cholula - level . 

 coworker # 1 got the asada plate ; the meat was bland and the beans were a little too creamy for my liking .   i quickly apologized to my quesadilla for straying .   coworker # 2 is a fellow foodie and had the shrimp tacos .   she was protecting her plate like a mother bear over a cub so i knew better and thought , "" next time "" . 

 i 've since been back and tried desperately to look at something else on the menu but the chicken quesadilla estilo del rey kept beckoning to me .   soon my love , we will reunite ... 

 oh- and the suit got mad street cred ..."
2,"i 'd characterize myself as a pho ho ( i know that does n't rhyme ) so this rating is going to be lower than what other people may thing simply because my standards for pho are snobbishly high . 

 a very cute place , the decor and ambiance seems built very much upon the words "" serenity "" and "" harmony "" , which is great , but as you might tell with the tone of this post , comes off a little corny . 

 that said , the food here is not too bad .   for lunch , it 's a decently priced meal for a lot of grub . 

 i got the shrimp & pork spring rolls and the pho ( which they call beef noodles i believe ) .  

 my first impression unfortunately when the app came out was that the spring rolls used iceberg lettuce instead of basil or mint or a more dark green leafy green .   the iceberg lettuce gave the spring rolls a cheaper feel that i did n't really enjoy . 

 the pho was better though they seemed quite stingy on the accoutrement , as i got two jalapeno slices and a sorry looking stem of basil .   in addition , the thin slices of beef were definitely overcooked and tasted not unlike a sponge .   but the noodles themselves were solid and the broth with a little sriracha got my blood and tastebuds pumping . 

 i do n't know if i 'll come back but i would say for lunch , this place is not a bad place to introduce somebody to vietnamese food ."
5,dr. lee does excellent work and he and the staff are very friendly and professional .   the best dental care i have ever received and i have lived all over the country and grew up at the dentist with my bad teeth .   they work very well with children also .
4,"i dig this place , i really do , but the portions are small . they do make up for it   by packing a straight kick to your man or woman pleaser with zesty flavors . i did n't dig the guacamole - too much salt , but loved , loved , loved the chips that came with it . the place is quite spacious and modern with featured art on the walls . i went for dinner so the lighting was minimal giving the place a sexy , urban feel to it . the kind of lighting that makes you wonder if the people are really this good looking ? or is the lighting really just this good ? ? ? 

 the carne asada beef tacos were divine . really moist and succulent with just enough spice to make your taste buds tingle . two is hardly enough , so we also tried the fish tacos and well , i could smell the fishiness from across the table which makes me a little uncomfortable . i did try it , though and it was okay . not too fond of anything that tastes or smells too fishy . reminds me of unsanitized , dirty , dirty girls . ( haha , had to throw in a visual for you all ! ) 

 my favorite plate was the ensalada cortada . i loved all the ingredients mixed in together , especially the corn nuts . genius idea ! 

 for drinks , i had the la sangria . fruity , refreshing , and light tasting . it was really good , but i passed it on to my date in hopes of taking advantage of him later on . almost worked , but when we got to the normally secluded rooftop @ the clarendon hotel , they were hosting a social gathering of some sort with lots of people . damn . should 've drank my sangria . oh well ... another day since i will most definitely be back for some more gallo blanco . i ca n't wait to try their breakfast menu !"
4,wow ! i am definitely impressed .   i 've been to a different massage envy years and years ago and vowed never to go back because it was the most mediocre massage i had ever had .   my girlfriend was telling me about how great the therapists are at this location so i relented .   i scheduled a 90minute deep tissue / trigger point massage with joshua .   it was probably one of the best massages i 've had in a long time .   my back neck and shoulder felt so much better afterwards !   i was so happy after i even signed up for the monthly membership .... something very unlike me to do without thinking about it .   i guess this location is the only corporate owned store and not a franchise . no wonder ! :)
2,"meh .   service was friendly , and the atmosphere is bright and festive , but it 's pretty americanized mexican food .   i had a california burro ( $ 9.49 ) , which was a large size , and tasted ok , but for about 1/3 of the price and for about the same size , i can get a better tasting burro with the same type of ingredients at los favoritos .   i 've also had dishes with their baja sauce , which tends to be too heavy tasting for me ."
2,"winco foods is all the rage now .   will this continue or will winco lose it 's luster once it 's just another grocery store and the new kid in town ? 

 there 's nothing special about winco .   it 's your typical grocery .   i 'm not a savvy coupon clipper or price matcher so i can not attest to the savings to be had at winco .   a thrifty shopper i know claims the savings are to be had . 

 that said there are two negatives that shine brightly at winco : credit cards not accepted and cheap bags . 

 do not come here if your earnings are running low .   i just gathered my weekly groceries and expected to charge 'em .   not a surprise i was looking forward to after waiting in the long lines . 

 on my first visit most of the bags were torn up the seam and the handles were split .   for one reason or another the cashier actually helped bag my haul .   how she could hand over bags so blatantly ripped is beyond me . 

 on the plus side , winco stocks shasta tiki punch . 

 winco is n't a terrible place but i do n't see any reason to jettison fry 's and target ( unless i 'm in the mood for tiki punch ) . 

 take it or leave it ."
4,"i have seen this place for years and years but had never gone in until one night awhile ago .   it turned out to be a really cool bar with live music and great drink specials . 

 it 's a small place , but what it lacks in size , it makes up in character .   it has a vibe all its own and if you get there early , you can sit right up front and check out the band . 

 do something different and go to char 's , you 'll be glad you did ."
5,"i have been chipotle faithful for about 2 years now , and it was n't very difficult .   restaurants such as rubio 's and the blue burrito just did n't stack up to a chipotle burrito .   then came qdoba . 

 this restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of chipotle ( 2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former chipotle of choice ) .   i had a chicken burrito ( my chipotle norm ) so i could make as direct of a comparison as possible .  

 the food was great , and afterwards i did n't get that "" punched in the stomach "" feeling that chipotle gives me for some time after i eat it ( i am convinced their rice expands in your stomach , but it tastes good so i suffer through it ) .  

 i also picked up their frequent customer swipe card ( buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation ) .   this place is closer to my place than any chipotle , so i will be coming very often ! 

 p.s. if anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know ! 
 ( ku - doh - ba ? ? ? )"
2,""" honey i shrunk the lunch specials and the restaurant , too ! "" is more apropos of a name for thai basil . now do n't get me wrong , i like thai basil .   the food is decent and the interior is nice , but the tables / diners seem to be squished elbow - to - elbow new york style . spartan , but slightly upscale , this restaurant always seems to have a wait .  

 the yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut , spice , carrots chicken and potatoes .   i ca n't ever seem to get enough , and i really mean that .   the portions here are small , and while lunch portions are expectedly small , portions elsewhere ( at chanpen thai , for example ) are larger and less expensive . elsewhere the thai bbq chicken comes with 1/2 a chicken , but at thai basil they give you three lonely strips like cheapos !   the massaman curry and pad thai are pretty good too , but i feel they 're just ok .   i 've had better . 

 service is hit or miss here .   one thing that 's consistent : they always seem to be understaffed . once when i was dining alone ( at a 4-person table ) they had the nerve to ask me to move while in the middle of eating , to a 2-person table . 

 to me , thai basil is style over substance .   not impressed .   next ."
4,"we started our hike from the central/7th ave . entrance .   this is quite a hike initially .   you will be out of breath if you 're not a cardio master .   i 've been working out 5 days a week for the past 6 months and i was huffing and puffing a bit .   i felt like a chump because i was having a rough time at first , but after the initial hill , it 's not bad .  

 the views of phoenix are beautiful , but like dan e. 's review said ...... ""don't let the beautiful desert deceive you "" it is toasty up there even on a beautiful 85 degree day like yesterday .   always bring water !"
2,"i guess you really ca n't put lipstick on a pig . i will say this , it 's nice inside all new building and equipment , but it 's very much a westside gym . many raider hats and 0.0 eye candy . i would rather go to moon valley all the same new stuff but much better loking people . i will say this , it 's good to see people in a gym that need to be there , and it also seems very gay friendly ."
5,"in being a bit of a burrito man , i was suspicious that a torta could ever marvel a tortilla filled with meat .   however , all of the hype on yelp and man vs. food was appropriate , as the torta provided a massive yet tasty introduction to pork , turkey , guacamole , and a bunch of other hidden great tastes all in one sandwich .   the carne asada quesadilla blew us away-- huge in portion , amazing meat , and super flavorful .   i was also glad to be one of the few gringos in this place .   people were friendly toward us in any case .   check out the horchata for some authentic aguas frescas ..."
2,"this joins my long list of places that i really want to love , but ... 

 i love the atmosphere . i love what they say they stand for . i love the concept of two hippies dropping out and dropping back in as restaurateurs . 

 what i do n't love is the food . the chicken and fish tacos i had were bland . no flavoriing . thank god they had hot sauce ( not homemade , store bought ) on the table to spice things up a bit . 

 on a positive note , the prives were good and the salsa they serve with store - bought chips was n't bad . and the lemonade ( they were out of most flavors both times i visited ) was good . 

 but overall , maybe it 's time for the hippies to clean up their act . worry about the food a little more than the message ."
3,"super cool place i 've been to 3 - 4 times now and only drawback is the noise if you are with someone you want to have a conversation with . service could be better , but location and above average food at decent prices cancel that out ."
3,"yogurtbuilderz provides a good sized dining area with many choices of yogurt and toppings . i did find it a little difficult to locate when i attempted to find the building - it is tucked away in the back corner of a strip mall parking lot . it was dark , late at night and took a few passes around the parking lot to zero in on the location . the staff was very friendly and the place was busy even for a sunday night . for the staff and selection i give it a 3 star rating . it was good , but i did n't find it any different than the growing list of competition . 

 i know this place is popular and self - serve frozen yogurt establishments are all the rage now . the economic model is great - you pay by the ounce and have your choice of any variety of yogurt and any topping available . customers have the opportunity to build it as they wish , which allows those with specific tastes to have their wants fulfilled more so than a traditional store offering the generic selection of choices . 

 all of that in mind , i do n't like it ( the industry ) . too many choices creates an opportunity for indecision and slows down the lines as people stand around wondering what to put in it next . for those new to the game , you can create something that turns out to be rather nasty - for example , the white chocolate sauce is really very sweet and i find if mixed with other toppings makes it almost unbearable . the other reason i do not like these places is that i do not like to pay for food that i then have to make and serve myself . i go to restaurants and pay for a meal rather than cook it at home because a ) i do n't like doing it and b ) i am horrific at it . while frozen yogurt does not require much preparation , there is still some assembly required . if i am paying , i prefer to have it built for me . but i realize i am in the minority . as popular as these chains are becoming i would n't be surprised to see "" froyo "" overtake "" unfriend "" as word of the year in 2010 ."
2,"food was tolerable , and tasteless .   the chips were actually tostadas that were extremely hard ( almost stale ) when eating . the entrees we ordered were bland .   the rice and beans had no flavor at all .   maybe that is baja style of food , but could n't find the flavor anywhere . 
 the service was great and the ambiance was wonderful , but i do n't think we 'll be going to this place again ."
5,best chocolate croissants ever ! ! ! !
5,"excuse me . how in the world have i lived walking distance from cornish pasty company for over a month and have only barely heard of this gem ? ! that s what i want to know . 

 a friend introduced us to cornish pasty saying it is "" the best restaurant ever "" . i best give it a try then right ? the tempe location is smaller than the mesa location but i love its vibe . a small narrow walking space between people sitting at a counter behind the kitchen and people sitting at teeny tiny tables , dim lit lighting and candles and for the most part , pretty good music . 

 my man and i ordered the mexican pasty and the rosemary chicken pasty . they were unbelievable ! so good . the mexican pasty was definitely the better of the two but i 'd order both of them again any day . a little heavy dinner action to make a girl feel full and happy . i respect restaurants that have a plethora of vegetarian options . what generation are you living in if you do n't offer veggie options these days ? get with the program all you other restaurants . you know who you are ! 

 i loved the entire experience and ca n't wait for our next trip ."
4,great store but lack of certain items
5,"20 % off with a yelp check in ? score ! 

 they have very unique , colorful and patterned vintage clothing for sale . but what i liked most about this store is their vintage jewelry ! there 's a local jeweler who makes rings out of old school buttons and brooches . i snatched up two really cute vintage rings ."
2,"earlier this week , we used our handy google mobile app to locate what we hoped was authentic mexican food . we were craving flavorful salsa and well - spiced meat dishes after a long , warm day in the desert . what we found here was slightly different than we were expecting ...... the chips were made of corn and flour tortillas , which was a nice surprise but way too filling while waiting for our food . the salsa was just fresh tomatoes with some cilantro ( or maybe even parsley ? ) for color . 
 it was "" taco tuesday "" , which here meant all - you - can - eat of crunchy or soft with 3 different filling choices.""hamburger helper - esque flavored shredded beef tacos "" , according to my teen son . ooops :( i ordered the "" award - winning green chili sweet tamale "" . i fear they left the winners with the judges , for they did n't make it to my table . the tamales were dry and contained about a tablespoon of chopped chiles throughout . and , although they were sweet as promised , they lacked depth of flavour overall . 
 the service was fine and the refills on soft drinks was fair , but i really was hoping for more . we are in town for a couple of weeks and may try it one more time since it 's close to our accommodations , but with all these tex - mex and mexicali flavour houses to choose from , it will take a lot to win us over for a better review ."
5,"really good , healthy food .   owner is super friendly . would definitely recommend . :)"
5,"this review is based on an event i attended here . i did not stay at the hotel as a guest or experience the bar . i was a guest at the etiquette dinner put on by asu and affiliates . from the moment i entered the hotel , i felt welcomed . each employee i passed greeted me with a smile and professionality . i thought the hotel interior was really cool also . when i was leaving the event , i thought how strange that locals never frequent hotels in their cities . i should try it !"
5,"lots of cool , cute and educational things here for my two kiddies . i stop in here for each birthday / christmas to balance out the "" junk "" toys . i love the art project portfolio that is divided by school year and the school memory books . :)"
4,"one thing you will notice about zia 's , they really work to great everyone who comes into the store , and that is , i think , indicative of the overall spirit of service you can expect to find in this store filled with a surprising cast of beatnik , bearded , tattooed , and pierced staff that you will find at this emporium of music and cinema . some items are a bit pricey but wonderfully fun to drift through the isles and see what you can find in the used section of the store . i 'm more of a cinema person myself and just picked up a blue - ray and a dvd video last night ( sort of a payday tradition for me ) . even better , when i 've compiled too many movies in my personal collection , i can take them down to recycle them into the used section and have more credit to spend on other new items in the store . 

 though i 'm not remotely beatnik in appearance ( firmly a member of the establishment in appearance ) i 've always been warmly greeted and welcomed by the delightful staff at zia 's and consider it to be an important and unique part of the downtown mill experience . 

 one thing i would like to see them do , and maybe i 've overlooked it , is carry some actual vinyl albums , but there is only so much space , but that seems like it would fit with the overall ethos of this fine establishment ."
5,great food ! ! ! the french dip is to die for ! ! great service ! clean and fancy especially for the area it 's located in !   def a hidden gem ! my husband and i both love going here and ca n't wait until next time .
5,"i 'm not gon na lie , i possibly had the best sunny side up eggs ever . 
 a simple dish so rarely cooked perfectly ."
4,"i am with some of the others in not understanding these poor reviews . i am from rhode island and italian food is at our fingertips , and in arizona , there are few and far between authentic non chain italian restaurants . i feel that although ambiance is important , i did n't see anything wrong with lo cascio 's . there were no cheesy paper protectors over a linen table cloth , and there were no paper place mats with several business names , so not sure what the issue was there . and as far as the music .... i would be annoyed too if i had to work there every night , but again , it only added to the atmosphere . in my opinion , some of the best italian food does not come with yuppie atmosphere . 
   for the appetizer we had the fried mozzarella which my husband and i enjoyed very much . the marinara poured over it was on the chunkier side and i loved it because it tasted just like a sauce an old italian friend of mine made . it was perfect . i had eggplant parmesan for my entree , and it tasted just like nyc italian . the eggplant did n't have the shit fried out of it , and it had the finest light coating just the way i love my favorite dish . and my husband had veal milanese which was out of this world . it was in a sauce of lemon and wine , mushrooms and artichokes . 
   i also want to mention , we had the most attentive waitress that i have ever had . her name is katie , and she was very sweet always asking us after each course if we needed anything and how everything tasted . 
   we will definitely be back here , we live down the road now in our new home and i am very happy there is a great little italian restaurant nearby . i am also happy i did n't let the negative reviews scare me ."
4,"happened upon four peaks when we drove up to the restaurant we wanted to go to and there was n't a car in the parking lot ! my hubs and i thought it was just the temps in scottsdale , and everyone headed out of town for the weekend . however , when we walked into four peaks , it blew our assumption out of the water . the place was packed and the only seat left was in the bar , which was ok since we were only there for appetizers and beer . 

 we ended up ordering 1 entree as an appetizer , the fish and chips . the were quite good ! nicely cooked , not overly greasy and very crunchy .   hubs got a dark and i got a light . we were very pleased with the beer and will be looking for a 6-pack in the stores . 

 i 'm looking forward to heading back to scottsdale to hang out here a bit longer and try some of their great looking menu !"
3,"probably more worthy of 3.5 stars .   damn the yelp constraints !   marketplace was pretty busy tonight now that you can actually go out in the evening without a gentle breeze feeling more like a blow torch in your face .   in spite of that , our wait to be seated was fairly quick .   but where was our server ?   outside listening to the band ?   we need liquid refreshment ! 

 finally our server arrived and apologized for the wait at the same time the manager arrived and also apologized and comped us an appetizer .   wow !   we had n't even complained .   we had the hummus which was very tasty but a little thin and a mango tandoori chicken pizza .   nice combination of sweet mango , spicy curry sauce , and the grilled chicken .   service was excellent once we got over the initial bump . 

 while i usually do n't plan to go to cpk , it 's nice to know this one is there ."
5,"i love this place ..   this is my sushi bar .   danny , one of the two sushi chef 's is awesome .   i have always found their sushi to be very fresh . 

 about a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu .   with rolls like these : dirty harry , mr. miagi , rio , you can not go wrong .   especially if you like spicy ( like me ) ! 

 even the non - sushi is great .   this is one place my 6 year old loves that does n't have a drive through window . 

 also , $ 4.50 sake bombs ! ! !   $ 4.50 ! 

 go here .   try it .   do n't be scared off by a couple of so - so ( ok , 1 bad ) reviews .   i am looking to even have a uye here in the near future !   should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled . 

 almost forgot !   they have some big screen tv 's !   watch sports here !   they are hugely popular for ufc fights and football ..  

 just go .   now ..   seriously .   review part is over ..   you are wasting time reading the fodder i have written here .   you could be finding your keys ..   putting on socks and shoes ..   hell , skip the socks ..   wear sandals .   save time ."
5,"i love the story time program here ! i started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat . the staff here is amazing ! it is a 30 minute session of singing , dancing , stories and bubbles . we look forward to this every week now . my daughter loves the take home cut out and coloring sheet . the first thing she does is come home and color it . i am so thankful for this free program ."
5,ouchh ... my fuckin head is pounding this morning .   thanks a lot guys !
5,"hard to find new york pizza that tastes like new york pizza .   all the way from morristown , nj , this place is now the only place i order ny style pizza ."
5,i was here for the yelp event recently and loved it .   the facility was great and yelp did a good job putting together the event .   i noticed there was a lot to do there .   i am already planning to come back with my nephews so i can have fun walking around the mock grocery store .   i 'm also looking forward to racing my nephews through the car wash on tricycles .   bring energy when you come and prepare to have fun .
3,"salsa bar raid !   that is exactly why i do when i am at this place . the salsa bar is the main attraction for me . there are many great salsa options , plus fresh cilantro and peppers . some of the salsas are good enough to be eaten straight , like the mango salsa , it makes a good desert . 

 the menu for this place is somewhat somewhat limited t mostly burritos and tacos . recently the menu was revised and the cheaper items were removed and more expensive ones were added in their place . 

 every meal comes with a small side of chips , which adds even more use to the salsa bar . the grilled green onion that used to come with each meal is gone and missed ."
3,"food used to be a lot better , service too . not awful though ."
3,"this is a really fun place to grab some cocktails or beers before an event or game . my friends and i have a tradition of drinking here before dbacks games and we always love it . drinks are reasonable , especially if you ask the specials , and way cheaper than beers at bob . 

 as for food they have an awesome menu , but the food came off a bit cheap in quality to me so i do n't think it 's worth ten dollars a plate . but if your hungry it will get the job done ! although ... one of the days i want to try and eat one of those one pound hot dogs they have . it is a personal goal . 

 i recommend : 
 fox sports marg 
 beers 
 grape bombers"
4,"i have heard about this place for couple years before i actually get to try it out . their guacamole burger is my favorite , and the peanut butter malt was just amazing ! ! first time i tried , i ended up getting another one to go . they also have corn beef sandwich on thursday , which i have n't get the chance to try yet . only thing i dislike is that they close at 8 pm which is a bit too early for me ."
3,"in 1999 the az republic voted abacus inn best chinese in the valley . that is sad because chinese can be so much better . 

  but i do have to say that abacus inn does something nice that i do n't see too often in other chinese restaurants . they give you hot tea and water and fresh fried noodles with sauces when you are seated . 

 i had the yui shan chicken , it was a fail because of the inedible shiitake mushroom stems in my dish .   trying to eat the mushroom stem was like trying to chew a car tire but , i do have to admit the sauce was more developed than any sauced dishes i tried from the surrounding chinese restaurants including bamboo cafe , ginger china bistro , and shangri la. i liked the use of cucumber in the dish was light and tasty and successful . unfortunately the white meat chicken was dry . maybe a third string cook was on the day i was here and maybe this dish is normally prepared better ? 

 the sautéed spicy beef was more successful . the beef was very well prepared and unlike the yui shan dish this spicy beef really was very spicy . i am used to a more developed and balanced szechuan sauce so i was n't a fan of this dish from here . but i do note this sauce was better than what you 'd get from surrounding chinese restaurants . 

 the last time i was here i had the sizzling rice dish and that one impressed me because they cook the rice quickly in a very hot oil and puff the rice . 

 it 's a toss up between abacus inn and shangri la . abacus does some more impressive stuff but shangri la does cook moist chicken ."
5,"love this place .   great staff !   friendly , fun and knowledgable .   the food is always good ."
3,"i am a sucker for a theme restaurant . i have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick . when you arrive a nurse checks you in , gives you a hospital wrist band , and dresses you in a hospital gown . seriously , i love a gimmick more than the next person but the heart attack grill is 100 % gimmick and only 60 % good food . the menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties , french fries fried in lard , shakes , pure sugar coke , and pbr . they have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways . we ordered 2 single bypass burgers ( one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy , ) all you can eat lard fries , a vanilla shake , full sugar coke and a pbr . the burgers were ordinary , the fries were ordinary , and the service ( aside from being dressed as naughty nurses ) was ordinary . the only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake . 

 the bill came to around $ 30 , which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food . yeah , yeah , yeah , i get it . it is a gimmick . heart attack , fat , lard , waitresses dressed as nurses , cook dressed as doctors , sugar , beer ... whatever . it gets old pretty fast ."
4,"i have heard great things about this place and i had purchased one of those online deals to try it out .   i was not disappointed .   the only reason , i did n't give it 5 stars was because i was freezing .   but i had a small chocolate milkshake and the special of the day , philly cheesesteak .   my husband had a cheeseburger slider , chili cheese dog , and french fries .   we really liked the food .   if you want the sliders , make sure you order at least 3 , i would say , because they 're kind of small . 

 my husband is from illinois , so walking into chicago hamburger co , was amazing .   there is so much chicago decor , it 's ridiculous , but since i 've only been to chicago once , i liked reading all the signs and seeing pictures of former bears players .  

 we will most defiinitely return ."
5,"i ve been eating here more and more often lately , and i like the food .   if i want mexican food , and i am in the downtown chandler area , this is where i stop in . 

 the food quality is consistent .   being a creature of habit , i get the same thing every time i come here . 

 they are also serving cupcakes .   looks like the change the flavor every once in a while too .   i have had a margarita flavored one , and a dark chocolate and chili one .   tasty ."
1,"first of all , if you go here , please please please make sure you check your bill when it comes !   honestly .   we went here 3 times .   all 3 times we were over charged ....   either the menu 's were out of date , or we were "" past happy hour time "" ( bs ) ... oh and the other excuse ... we just changed our menu .   blah blah blah   p 

 then they always have to "" get a manager "" to come to the table , which takes forever !   ( i am sure they hope we leave )   plus ! the service sucks ass ! ! ! !   this is a definitely bait and switch ! 

 1st time it happened we just dealt with it , and was like , whatever ... 

 2nd time it happened , my daughter who just got back from deployment ( navy ) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there .   my husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy crazy over what we thought as we were there for happy hour .   the waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes , ( gimme a break )   finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of ' arguing about it .   we discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like , whatever ... 

 3rd time ...   took a friend there .   again we ordered devils ale .   on the menu it was listed at one price ... when we got the bill , it was almost twice as much .   we waited for our server to come back , she never did , she totally ignored us .   i gave her a dollar tip ( which is not like me , i tip very well , too well )   and i wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip .  

 if you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to san filepe 's   that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun .   we much prefer there , we wll never go to caddilac ranch again .   they say 3rd time is a charm , well , it is ... its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they do nt give a crap ! 

 oh and if i did n't have to give a star , i would n't have ."
3,"the problem with a place like this is the hype .   five stars from yelpers , must be amazing !   but sorry , i 've had better eggs benedict .   for me just too far to drive for the mediocre food and marginal service ."
4,my boyfriend just reviewed this place and although we have never   been here together - i thought that i might chime in as well . i really enjoyed this little burger place .   it makes eating a burger seem fancy in a very modern setting .   i really like the sweet potato french fries .... mmmmm !
5,"my daughter 's 128i bmw was horribly keyed this summer and we found harvil 's through state farm insurance . fred harvil was very friendly and helpful to work with and we really appreciated his service . she dropped her car off on monday i believe and she had the car back by friday . his rates were very good and ended up being lower than we had expected , and what we liked about him is that he was very honest . my daughter had accidentally backed her car into a pole earlier that summer and had n't gotten it fixed because she kept getting quoted around $ 500 and could n't do that , but because harvil was already going to fix the rest of the car he only charged her $ 100 to repair the back bumper which was really nice . he also set us up with a rental car for her through hertz that she was able to leave there at the shop and have them pick up which was great and convenient . 

 all in all , fred harvil was very pleasant to work with , timely , and left her car looking like new . definitely recommend !"

3,if i had n't recently found yogurtland in scottsdale i would be raving about this place . unfortunately it is   45 cents an ounce and the other place is 30 cents . both have a nice variety of flavors but this place is missing the water cooler . you do get a bit sticky from eating your treat . there is something they have that yogurtland does n't have . they have marshmallow and peanut butter in squeeze containers which is to die for ! !
1,"wow .....   not in a good way 

 the sashimi was good because all they did was cut it , but that was it.everything else made me wish i went real chinese ! not chinese making sushi , culture theives ! 
 p.s. snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll !"
4,"great establishment and especially for it being a chain . 

 the place is clean and has a transparent kitchen allowing us patrons to know that the ingredients are in good standing . the prices are within good range and the seating makes it very convenient for groups . 

 i like their menu it 's simple yet offers enough options to make it an agreeable spot ."
4,"thanks to amy d. for also introducing me to this quaint joint . 

 the smell of home cooking lured me in , great menu selections with sandwiches salads and hot dishes too , along with the daily specials which i think is one of each ( sandwich , salad , hot meal ) . 

 sandwiches come with fresh potato chips and a pickle spear , 
 i decided to try the tuna since they do n't put onions in it , hallelujah!(see pics ) 

 you know what it was pretty tasty , i even ate all my chips and the pickle ! my only complaint was the bread was a tad dry , but hey it happens . 

 tucked into a commercial business park i never would have found this on my own , but i have fantasized about going back next time i 'm in the area , maybe amy d. will take me out to lunch again :)"
1,"you want good food ? you 'd be better off smuggling goat cheese in your boot and risking an anal cavity search for doing so than eating at this airport . 

 you want scenery ? try desert . 


 you want a comfortable seat to wait for your delayed flight ?   well you are in the desert so you 'd probably better off finding a cactus and straddling it face first . 

 you want a relatively close connection for your flight ? well tough shit .   oh yeah , they 've got people movers but somehow they have this magical ability to disengage people 's legs .   yeah i know it sounds crazy but as soon as people step on to these things their legs stop moving and they plant their fat ass right in the middle of the walk way .   what s wrong with your legs you mammoth ! ?"
5,"what a beautiful hotel ! the clarendon is truly one of a kind . the staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need ... and extras :) the pool area is gorgeous and the atmosphere is delightful . i had the opportunity to meet the owner , ben bethel . what an astonishing young man he is ! i do n't know which is more impressive , his efforts to make the hotel as "" green "" as possible or the fact that he helps guests with their bags as they walk through the door . i ca n't wait for another excuse to stay at the clarendon again !"
5,"i take the light - rail downtown sometimes just to go here . i walked in the first time to a bustling , energetic , singing , cheering crowd and thought , "" where the h am i ? ? "" i felt like i had left phoenix and ended up in a far away magical land of wonder and excitement . food is decent for a bar , great beer , great local music ( it 's the first time i saw the waters ) . downtown phoenix needs more places like this ."
3,"i recently attended a conference in az and stayed at the squaw peak . the grounds were very nice , and with all the on - site activities this hotel would be quite a draw for the kids . 

 being i do n't have any kids , plus it was too cold to be out by the pool , activities on site were pretty limited . the gym facilities and the comfort of the bed made up for the lack of adult festivities . the gym was good sized and had ample new equipment . the bed was really comfortable and had great pillows . 

 great for a family vacation , a - ok for the business traveler ."
3,"had lunch at zinc for the first time recently right as they were opening .   considering they were not yet busy , we had pretty mediocre service .   to begin with , we were not offered bread .   since it was our first visit , i would n't have necessarily assumed we would get bread , but i noticed other tables had it , so naturally i felt slighted .   and then the cardinal sin of serving .   i was maybe 25 % through my meal , when our server appeared with our check and asked if we would like dessert .   well , i do n't know .   i have n't really eaten yet .   my husband was n't even finished , and he eats like he 's still in the military .   needless to say , i just took the check and short - changed her tip in return for short - changing the time i was apparently allotted for eating . 

 as for the food .   i had the macaroni au gratin with smoked ham as well as their up sell of parmesan truffle fries .   i liked the mac and cheese .   not the best i 've had , but pretty good .   the fries were okay .   but i 've never understood the concept of dressing up plain ' ole french fries and serving them with ketchup .   if i 'm not going to get a nice aioli or some other special dipping sauce , i 'd rather just have the fries sans all the other crap . 

 i would n't necessarily object to a return visit if i 'm in the area , but i wo n't be breaking down their door .   just as well , i doubt they would care ."
5,"i actually visited here about 5 months ago , but i liked it so much i figured i should give it a few good words ! 

 i was at the mall looking for something healthier than a pizza or burger and decided upon this place . it is part of their little slogan after all ! 

 i was not disappointed . i chose the beef kabob with a side of fries and pita bread with a cup of hummus . everything was positively fresh and absolutely delicious . and the portions were big , too . i did n't think i would be filled up after the meal , but i was stuffed ! 

 the staff was very friendly and cooked everything in a timely manner . i was surprised they were n't getting nearly as much business as the other joints around the food court . they do n't know what they 're missing !"
5,"i think this food is phenomenal . this was the first place i tried asian food in az when moving out here years ago . it has grown since then and the food is always top notch . 

 for a late sunday afternoon lunch , the place was nearly empty but their takeout counter was constantly busy . our server was friendly and attentive and kept our water glass filled . 

 it 's been a while since i ate for the review for which i write so i do n't remember exactly what it was , but it had the big , wide rice noodles which i love . i do remember that the dish was excellent and big enough to supply leftovers for lunch the next day . 
 they ask how spicy and i 've eaten thai food "" spicy "" and it is downright dangerous , so we opted for "" medium "" with a side of spice juice ... which was hot ! 

 we will continue to patronize tottie 's as they are consistent and the food and service has always been very , very , very good . and very reasonable prices ."
5,"well dang gummit .... git on over here and by me some camo flawj .... tha kind that has little dangly moss on it .... and while yur at it , i need me a gun .... 

 too bad i already have a gun and camo . i use to be a big hunter .... deer , dove , turkey , squirrel , ducks etc . it 's what you do in south georgia when your fridge is empty and you 're hungry . 

 this bass pro shops is enormous ! ! ! ! ! i love it . although i do n't hunt anymore , my brother and father do , so every year i get gift cards for them from bass pro shops . the gear and guns are more expensive than other places , but their selection is incredible . when my dad comes out here , i ca n't wait to take him here to see all the taxidermy and fish tanks ... i know he 'll love it . 

 the staff is usually friendly . the firearms dept is a bit intimidating and the guys at the counter can be smart asses . but this place is just really neat overall . it is also a family retreat , so do n't be surprised to see hundreds of kids running wild while their parents let them be terrors ."
5,"i 've been taking mine and my family 's cars to cathedral for more than a decade . we are always treated fairly , and always have a good experience - the guys always stand by their work and "" go the extra mile "" to be sure our cars are fixed properly . they work on both our new(er ) cars and my cars from the 50s and 60s . 

 whenever anyone is looking for a mechanic , i will send them here without fail - and john and the guys at cathedral have always come through by totally taking care of anyone i send to them . in a business filled with some sketchy practices , i know that whether i send my wife , a friend , or a coworker to cathedral they will be treated honestly and fairly . cars break and break down , that 's a fact of owning one . i 'm glad i have cathedral to make dealing with it so easy and stress free so i can get back on the road as quickly and cheaply as possible ."
4,"the folks at national car rental were very accommodating and even helped me upgrade my rental at little cost to me .   if the deal was right , i would definitely use this company again when visiting phoenix !"
4,"so wifey and i decided to check this place out for our monthly date night . it 's a cool little spot around 12th st and oak , in the middle of a neighborhood . the decor is very modern , but warm and inviting . we opted to get an appetizer and a few of the small plates rather than the larger plates they had . they had a balanced but approachable wine list , i had an awesome tempranillo for under 10 bucks a glass !   we opted for the crispy shrimp and okra for the appetizer , which came with this spicy banana sauce and this cool yogurt sauce .   i really really liked this dish , the okra was great and the shrimp were succulent and perfectly cooked . not sure about the banana sauce , but overall a great dish . we then decided to get the stuffed dates with crispy schreiner 's chorizo and manchego . it came with dressed spinach , prob one of my fave dishes in phoenix right now !   we also ordered the macaroni and cheese and i forgot to mention the toasted bread and roasted garlic we ordered . the bread and garlic was just okay , nothing special .   i , surprisingly , was not a fan of the mac and cheese either , it seemed very grainy ( i know it was chock full of parmesan so that 's probably what it was , but it was just unappealing to me ) . overall this place has potential . i 'll definitely go back , especially because we got out with 3 glasses of wine and 4 small dishes with tax and tip for under $ 70.00 ! !"
5,"this review is mainly for the bar and a few light ( ok not light , but small ) snacks .  

 met with a couple people during their soft opening and there was absolutely nothing soft about it .   i got there a few minutes early and posted up at the bar to grab a manhattan .   this drink is usually my boozometer when i am trying a place first .   ok , we 've got something here , this drink is tasty .   started talking to the bartenders and got a really comfortable feeling from them .   when was the last time that you sit down to the bar and   they ask your name , tell you their 's , and then shake your hand ?  

 after the manhattan the rest of the group showed .   the bar was a little too busy to fit the three of us so i took my second drink , sazerac , to the table .   sazerac was tasty as well .   rest of the table ordered some drinks and nothing negative to be said anywhere .   we each had around 4 or 5 drinks and every last one of them was delicious .  

 we were comped a few bar snack and all were delicious but the stand out was the warm nuts . ( twss )   mixed nuts warmed with herbs de provence and a little bit of chili flake i believe .   soooooo good .  

 as for the style of the place it is fantastic .   feels cool but not cliche .   the palomar staff did a fantastic job of designing this space .   as of now this is the one place in city scape that is worth while ."
4,"i see a few of the previous reviews discussing issues with service , but i have always had good service at this place .   i have only been in a handful of times , but we never have to wait very long to be helped , and the staff is very friendly . 
 i have only ordered salads there , but i 've enjoyed the three that i 've tried ( maggie 's , jamaican jerk chicken , and greek ) .   the salad dressing always comes on the side , which is perfect , because that is how i like to order salads ( so i can control the amount of dressing . )   my husband loves the pulled pork , although it 's popular and sells out pretty quickly from our experience ."
3,i came in here to order to get takeout it was 19.99 for 2 cheese pizza 's ummm not so cheap . they only use 1 type of cheese the pizza was not great i would nt go that route again but i am willing to go back and try the veggie pizza . i surprised my brother with some suicide wing 's i do nt eat meat but i did try the sauce and ate some w my pizza it was hot . he loved them all 20 were gone at the end of the night . they said they were so hot but the boys just could nt stop eating them . they said they were very good meaty and not too vinegary . an extra star for making the boys happy with the hella hot wings that night . fyi they probably use hydrogenated oils here by the way but i did nt ask !
4,"this is a nice store .   it is well organized and the shelves are neat .   in my experince when going to a store like home goods , marshalls or t.j. maxx the shelves are always a mess and it 's hard to sort through it all .   that is what i 've always hated about these stores .   this one is different .   and you actually see the people working on the shelves while you 're there .   the bath department is well organized and neat .   they have some nice furniture although i think the prices on the furniture are a little high for what is supposed to be a discount type store .   the main reason i come here is the candles .   they usually have a nice selection of yankee candles for 1/3 of the price you would pay in the yc store .   i 've gotten large tumblers for $ 9.99 !   that is a steal !   i also picked up a great shower caddy for $ 12 that probably would have been $ 20 or more elsewhere .   i stop by here when i go to sprouts which is right next door ."
4,"i 'm a value sorta guy ... considering that , i should hate this place on paper , but the quality , selection of items you wo n't find other places , and general vibe of the store are fantastic .   you will pay top dollar , but you get top notch stuff in return ! their baked goods are exquisite , their meats are the most gorgeous chunks of dead flesh you 'll ever see , and then .. there 's the beer & wine . wow ."
1,"i can summarize this in one word .   yuck !   we went for dinner / supper , which is part of the problem .   we ordered t - bone steak and chicken .   the salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin .   we ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as "" well done "" anyway .   everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not .   at least the staff was friendly enough and food ( if you call it that ) was served quickly .   my personal recommendation is that if you 're not going to eat breakfast , go somewhere else ."
3,"it 's kinda comfy setting .... for the non-(official ) , yelp event , they had penne pasta ... but sonoma 's specialty is rotisserie chicken ...... nice but i sure would have liked to taste what the place raves about --- chicken !   oh well , the pasta was ok for what it was .   what i truly enjoyed about sonoma was the layout .   you can easily entertain a fairly large crowd and not be on top of each other .   i need to come back and try their chicken then re - write this review . 

 the parking upstairs for the event was nice also , but later on at night , it seems a bit spooky to be walking up in the parking area alone and in the middle of city center where there are some pretty curious characters about~~~i would prefer coming with more than one person if parking at night in the upper garage ( personal preference ) . 

 the yelp folks!---way too cool !   i am so glad to have discovered yelp !   best thing i 've done in ages.---cheers yelpers !"
2,"first off , let me say that i live almost across the street from here and have been waiting for a grocery store downtown for almost 5 years .   i was there the very first day they were open and have been back three or four times since .   i waited to write my review until they had their "" grand opening "" and until they had gotten into the groove of having a market . 

 boy , where do i start with the complaints ?   the biggest complaint is not so much the hours but the days that they are open .   maybe i 'm weird but i do my grocery shopping on sunday .   we specifically did n't get a few things from f&e because we wanted the ones from the market .   i try and go sunday but they are closed .   try and go back monday ... they are closed .   at this point , i really need those items and i 'm just going to buy them from a normal store .   it does n't make any sense why you would have a ton of vendors there on saturday dropping off their goods only to have them sit , locked up , until tuesday .   if you need two days off , take saturday and wednesday off when the outdoor market is in full swing . 

 my next complaint is the selection .   i 'm not even going to complain that you do n't have basic things like fruit or butter .   i 'm going to complain that you carry fish from alaska ( not local ) and that you carry shamrock milk ! wtf ! you could be carrying superfarm milk , butter , and ice cream but instead you carry the same thing target has .   try supporting real local business instead of mega - giant shamrock farms . 

 finally , what 's with the "" wine bar "" ?   is it actually somewhere in the building or am i supposed to sit in the middle of the produce and drink ?   it really feels like too much room was wasted on the sandwich / wine bar counter area and not enough was set aside for actual groceries .  

 i know this place will get better but right now one would be pretty hard pressed to do their grocery shopping here ."
4,fresh and easy 's are great .   my only issues is how quickly some of the foods from this store go bad .   do n't buy for a week from now unless it is frozen !
4,"are you looking to get a cat ? if so , check out petsmart . my wife and i adopted a kitten here and she 's awesome . 

 there are always several cats ( occasionally dogs ) looking for a good home , some older cats ( a few years old and some kittens . ) there is an adoption fee , but the cats will come with their shots and are neutered / spayed . 

 we also use this store to get both wet and dry food and toys on occasion . there are many sizes and brands to choose from at good prices . the food is cheaper at petsmart than petco , unless the item is on sale . 

 i would recommend to get a petsmart card to save a few bucks . 

 the store is always clean and staff very friendly and helpful ."
4,"great location , great food , and nice ambiance .   the menu is n't huge , but this is a nice french cafe type setting if that 's what you 're into ."
5,outstanding and fantastalistic comes to mind . real good .
4,"the new store is smaller than the previous one . but it 's still a reliable digging source for records . i wish there was a better selection of dance tracks , but that is n't really their thing . they did have the new chromatics and glass candy 12 "" singles when i was in there last , which was nice . 

 great selection of hip hop vinyl , some awesome indie records , etc . definitely recommend this if you 're in the tempe area ."
5,"great service , efficient bartender , the place was packed and he flew around that place serving brewski 's nonstop ... awesome outdoor patio and great view of camelback ... happy to see this little gem and will be back"
3,"i have never been into soul food per se , but my husband woke up craving some chicken and waffles , and well , you can guess where we ended up . we were so pumped that there was kool aid on the menu , so we ordered that immediately . i do n't know why every restaurant does n't do this ... kool aid is amazing . the service was decent - our waitress was quite friendly , and the food came out quick . i got biscuits and gravy , which was pretty delish . the gravy was thick and filling . so filling , in fact , that i could n't finish them . i also got a side of mac and cheese which was not great , and i did n't eat a lot of it . overall , i 'd give this place a solid 3 . i 'd come back again , but mostly because my husband thought it was some kind of wonderful ."
2,"i think the high reviews of sofrita must simply be a function of the limited dining options in fountain hills as this is the worst excuse for tapas that i 've ever had .   we walked in and were greeted by a strange , musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal .   we should have taken that as an indication of what was to come and left , but based on the great reviews , decided to stay .   big mistake . 

 i ordered a red sangria which was okay , but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so i 'm not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional .   we ordered the olives , fried potatoes , grilled zucchini , shisito peppers , and four different types of bruschetta .   the olives were , well , olives ( tough to ruin those ) but also contained some off - putting caperberries that we avoided .   the grilled zucchini was just plain zucchini with no seasoning whatsoever served with a side of what looked like potato salad as a dip , but we never really could identify what that substance was as it had absolutely no flavor so we opted to avoid the fat that it was obviously adding to the zucchini .   the shisito peppers had no spice or flavor at all and were absolutely swimming in oil .   i 've never had a "" roasted "" pepper that was so soaked in grease .   the waitress asked if we did n't like the peppers when she noticed that all but a few remained and when we pointed out how greasy they were , politely took them off the bill .   the four pieces of bruschetta were all of different varieties : roasted eggplant ; ripe tomatoes ; avocado and beans ; and grilled artichoke with cheese .   the bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor at all .   in fact , i think if i had just closed my eyes and randomly selected one off the plate , i probably would n't have been able to tell which it was .   the fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal , which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato . 

 the atmosphere was severely lacking as there were candles on all of the tables and numerous votives on the walls , but not a single one was lit .   the restroom was extremely dark and was absolutely filled with unlit votive candles so i 'm not sure if this was an attempt at saving costs , but had i known this , i would have gladly spared a box of votives from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate .   the place is also incredibly tiny so i have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have spoken of would perform .   if anyone tried to move through there , they would literally be bumping into tables .  

 while i love tapas style dining , if this were the only tapas restaurant that there was , i would gladly forego the experience .   needless to say , we wo n't be back ."
5,"one of my fave places in phoenix . 
 well stocked and friendly staff . 
 i do n't normally peruse the dvds or cds because they tend to be pricey , but one day i just decided to take a look . 
 that 's when border 's became one of my fave places . 
 i was able to find a fairly rare documentary dvd . 
 i paid 40 bucks for it , but have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before . 
 i very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness . 
 for that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for . 
 i was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the dvd but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in . 
 even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yet , the staffer called to have someone open the box , and bring a copy for me to look at . 
 i bought that too ! 
 i will coninue to patronize borders and any other book store that chooses not to censor !"
3,"what can you say about beni 's - not bad and not great . 

 i have been to benihana in several different cities and for a chain teppan restaurant it 's ok .   my fave was in san diego , could have been the company we were with .   i would definately say they are pretty consistant everytime we have been .   the teppan is a little pricey , the sushi is consistantly good ( they also offer the all you can eat sushi ) , and the sake selection is ok ( very average ) .   i do get tired of hearing the birthday song 10 to 15 times while we are dining ."
5,"they had kool aid ! i was so happy to see it :) 

 the chicken and waffles were really good ... my girlfriend and i went straight there from the airport , before going to our hotel , and it was completely worth it ... 

 yeah , waiting outside in 100 degree heat is n't ideal , but for 10 minutes you can deal with it ... especially when they had someone outside giving out water 

 if you 're ever in phoenix like us , or live out there , definitely stop in ! ! !"
1,"piece of * * * * manager would n't put air conditioning on yesterday . it was 90 . 
 they just lost alot of business ."
4,it was pretty good . but i do nt know much about indian food . it was better than the only other place i 've been too which had dirty grey chicken in its dishes . taste was good .
4,"i was a regular at the nello 's on 48th st and warner in awhatukee , so i was pretty interested in trying this location out .   they are all owned individually so i expected it to be a little bit different which it was .   still good , but i think i like some of the selections of the other nello 's better .   not that big of a deal because i have already been here twice over the last 2 weeks , but i liked the soup of the day and the panini 's they had at the one in awhatukee .   still a great place !"
3,"the food at beaver choice scandinavian bistro is delicious ; a little unusual , but easily understood . hearty and reasonably priced . you can find out all about it at azcentral.com in an article by howard seftel . then , after reading this survival guide , you should go and try it . 

      things you will need : 
  1 . an afternoon or evening with no commitments other than your meal . this could take a long , long time . 
  2 . a pen and a piece of paper on which to write your order ( along with an alternate choice ) . 
  3 . dining companions who all enjoy the same foods and are willing to eat off the same plate . 
  4 . a snack to tide you over until your food arrives . 
  5 . a sense of humor ( but try not to laugh out loud ) , 

      here 's our experience : 

      four of us entered the small , 20 seat restaurant at 12:10 . there were six other people seated at the minimalist glass top tables . a large , and very appetizing looking catering order was taking up another table . we were given menus and told to order at the counter . there were many , many choices of entrees ( a few warned that they would take between 20 and 35 minutes to prepare - we avoided those ) , and each one came with a choice of four side dishes . you can see why a paper and pen might come in handy . ken went to place our order , but he had to wait for three other people who had arrived before him . it took a while .   then he was told that my entree choice was not available because they had run out of gravlax . i came up with another selection , and ken went back to the counter - where another group of people had taken his place and were ordering . another wait , then my second choice was n't available either . the sauce had to be reduced and would n't be ready until tuesday . i figured i 'd be safe with a third choice of swedish meatballs , so i yelled over to ken who saw that each of our orders was being written on a separate piece of paper . odd . 

      we settled in to wait for our food . our drinks were brought to the table . sena 's eyes popped when she sipped the pitch black coffee . the waitress said it was always that strong and that there was no milk or half and half available , but she could bring out some heavy cream . i noticed that food was coming out of the kitchen painfully slowly . one dish to one table , a while later , one dish to a different table . companions were left twiddling their thumbs . it so reminded me of hell 's kitchen - i could hear gordon ramsey going ballistic : "" shut it down you & * # $ % ! ! ! ! "" . at about 1 pm my swedish meatballs were delivered . i put the plate in the middle of the table and invited everybody to dig in . luckily the servings are large . we finished that off and waited another ten minutes before sena 's chicken schnitzel arrived . that too was shared . at about 1:35 ken 's entree was brought . that left leon , who had ordered tilapia . we flagged down the owner and told her that we had a 2 pm engagement and would like our remaining dish . she said she 'd look into it , went into the kitchen and was not seen again . a while later another staff member came over and told us that there had been a large catering order , that they had only a six burner stove   and that 2 employees had called in sick . i mentioned that i did n't think it was right to serve some people at a table and not others . "" this is the way we do it , we 're not going to change it , and howard seftel thought it was all right "" , was the emphatic reply . more waiting . at 1:50 a different staff member came over and said it would be a few more minutes . to our disconcerted rumblings he said - and you 're not going to believe this - "" the fish has to be defrosted slowly because of the parasites .... ""   at this point , i 'll confess , i started to laugh loudly and somewhat 
 hysterically . it may have been rude , but i could n't help myself . 

      we were out of time , so leon decided he 'd take the fish to go . ken went up to the counter and gave one of my valley vittles cards to the "" parasite "" staff member , saying that the food was great but the service terrible . at which point the staff member had a melt - down , yelled at ken to get out of his restaurant , then went slamming through the kitchen kicking something on the way out . 

      this was truly one of the oddest dining experiences i 've ever had . very alice in wonderland . but if you go equipped with the five items mentioned above , you 'll have some excellent food ."
4,"the price is right ! 16 bucks for two huge lunches , chips & salsa and two drinks . 

 if you 're looking for upscale , squeaky clean and scottsdalish , this ai n't your place . if you 're looking for good mexican food , at reasonable prices , quick service and great flavor head on over to carolina 's ."
4,i went back recently and noticed thatt the quantity of tuna they use in the sandwich has dramatically decreased .   the bread is still as good as ever but it was a little disappointing to see that happen .   hopefully it was just a once time thing .   will keep you posted ...
5,"get your passport , we 're going to mexico . 

 ca n't find your passport ?   still waiting for it from the state department ?   no worries , pack your bag and head to the ranch market ! 

 this place is the best !   the food court is wonderful with so many tasty dishes .   and the produce department is crazy !   2 lbs of grapes for 99 cents , 8 cucumbers for a dollar , 17 cents for a bunch of cilantro , 7 -- yes , seven pounds of watermelon for 99 cents .   you can go crazy with produce and not break the bank .  

 the tamales are huge and the tortillas , oh the tortillas . 

 do n't be frightened , do n't get intimidated , it 's just a grocery store people !"
2,"i ve had dinner there a couple of times .    the bar is great and the drinks are ok .   the outdoor patio looks comfy and inviting .   it has a large outdoor fireplace .   the inside atmosphere is busy but fun .   the food is always good .   fish and steak tacos are fantastic .   the macaroni and cheese is one of the best i have ever had and my brother who was visiting from kansas almost o.d.'d on   the stuff .   my only issue would the lack of an obvious manager on the floor or presence of any hierarchy .   also the lack of hats in the kitchen bothered me a little so do n't look if that bothers you also .  

 stopped going back , very erratic dining experience .   over- priced and extremely uneven service .   the wait staff seems completely untrained and unaware ."
1,"this was by far the worst restaurant experience i 've ever had .   i paid $ 20.00 for a show and dinner . i received the show only because it was from an outside source . the show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant i 'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served . they did n't have enough menu 's for people to even order off of . some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table . the show started at 7:00 , at 9:30 i still had no food . the people who did get food complained that it was terrible . maybe i should be happy i did n't get any food . when i asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it . the guys in the kitchen were overheard saying "" f --- k those people no more orders ! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back . we ended up at dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . seriously i 've never had such a bad experience in my life . can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund ? unbelievable"
5,"i love this bar . my first visit was in 2004 when it was known as bar nun . i 'd just moved to az and i was drawn in by the neon green light and funny name . little did i know it was the beginning of a love affair . 

 since i did n't know anyone yet i went by myself and sat at the bar . the staff was friendly and so were the patrons . some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly , and the bartender , jennifer , insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety . as if that was n't enough to make a fan out of me , i found out they serve $ 2 blue moons all day saturday and the food is awesome ! 

 the burgers are great , and you can order them rare if you like . i also became addicted to their bbq chicken sandwich . and the wings . they 'll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus . in fact i do n't thing there is anything that i have tried and disliked here . 

 thursday - sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band . usually classic rock or 80s stuff . they also have ntn and a ton of tvs if you 're into sports . 

 i was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment , i made sure my new house was within walking distance . not that you 'd need to walk , ( since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2 am i can see why you would n't want to walk ) they offer a free ride program on the weekends where they 'll pick you up and drop you off . that way you do n't have to worry about sheriff joe and wearing pink undies at tent city . 

 wow , i kinda wanna move back now . ck 's i miss you ! ! !"
4,"an industrial - chic bungalow built just inside of the coronado historic district that showcases a loved downtown in an urban setting . the art and people are always beautiful . 

 cappuccino , along with caffe latte are my two most common espresso drinks . this one today gets four shots of espresso . the cup is huge . the drink is excellent ."
5,"probably the most serious restaurant for food in scottsdale .   great attention to detail from the chefs , management and servers .   shin does warm up after a few visits - we 've been there probably 10 times in the last 18 months .   shinbay is a must for anyone truly into food .   given the ingredients - both the sheer number of them and the overall quality i would actually call the pricing here a downright bargain ."
3,"we made the trek down from northern phoenix to get some authentic ramen .   i wanted to love this place and i wanted it to be worth the trip , but it just was n't .   the decor is as previously described - you sort of time warp back to the 80 's but it is clean and well loved by its owner .   they do have a lot of authentic menu items and a great kids meal , but the ramen was just not that good .   its downfall was the broth .   hubby got the salmon chirashi which was also not that fresh .   if i 'm in the area , i may give it another try for the don - buris ."
3,if only they have more fresh produce i 'd stop by a lot more often !
4,"cafe lalibela is my absolute favorite ethiopian resteraunt in the greater phoenix area . located in a small shopping plaza near downtown tempe , this humble little place packs a whole lot of flavor with their authentic ethiopian fare . i love their braised meats ( particularly the beef and lamb dishes ) and your vegetarian friends will rejoice with lalibela 's amazing 
 selection of veggie sides . my mouth is watering just thinking about their potatoes , carrots , and cabbage dish as well as their carrot and green beans . their spicy lentils are probably my favorite lentils ever , and their injera ( thin spongey bread , sort of like naan ) is absolutely perfect . the super nice family that owns and operates this place are great and they 
 even offer some great ethiopian coffee , tea , and beers . one of the only things i really miss about tempe ."
3,x
1,i ve eaten here twice and i do nt think ill ever eat here again . i ordered the lettuce wraps and the food smelled like horrible bo . it made me so nauseous i could nt even eat it . the salad is decent but i still ca nt get over that smell !
4,great place to go have a beer and watch the game on one of there numerous televisions .
4,"tiny downgrade for mamma mia 's .   i have been here about a dozen times since my initial review , it 's become one of our office lunch spots .   they have raised the prices on the sandwiches significantly . the chicken parm sub is now $ 6.95 instead of $ 5.50 and i will not be ordering it again . i ordered it today and it was really limp and the breading all fell off the chicken . very little flavor , too much cheese , had to remove half of it .   it used to be so tasty and crispy , what happened . 

 anyway i still think they have the best pizza in the valley along with venezia 's . so i will continue to go and get their 2 slice and a drink deal for $ 3.50 ."
1,"i went today with three friends for dinner around 6 pm sunday night . though it seemed quite busy , i was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival . outside seating , despite a hot arizona summer , was pretty nice with shade . however , this is where the pleasanties end . 

 our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes . no one bothered to offer us drinks , and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers . when our waiter came , he did not even apologize for the wait , and we gave our orders : drinks , appetizers , and pita sandwiches . 

 the hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly , only twenty minutes later . both were alright , but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips , and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita . we asked our waiter for extra pita , and he kindly agreed . the entire duration of dinner , it never came . 

 refills were also a pain , as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter , and he would n't come until ten minutes later . 

 an hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches . i 've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour . half the tables outside already left , including tables that arrived after us , and we were the last ones served . the food was of average quality , and i 've been to better with cheaper prices . 

 slightly expensive , i can see as justified . but many agree that time is worth much more than money . i had an excessive amount , over an hour and a half , wasted on a decellerating sunday night . staff is kind of nice , but i suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself are n't immediately turned off . i can say for certain that i 'm never coming here again , and i 'll find myself at better places much closer to home ."
5,"great pho , boba :) and vermicelli .. awesome !"
1,"went there for a quick bite before the theater .    had the buffalo sloppy joes , and they were disgusting -- dry buns , thin sliced pickle .   then had the duck spring rolls -- also bad .    then in an effort to eat something we could tolerate , ordered the lettuce cups with shrimp , and they were just adquate .    very disappointing !"
2,tried this place multiple times .   many different items .   the only thing worth remembering were the margaritas and the had pretty good service .
2,"i am a steak lover but i must say this would n't be somewhere i would recommend . our steaks were cooked wrong , had a pretty blah taste and we sat in the restaurant for 20 min before anyone asked us about drinks . the drinks were $ 9 and were supposed to be "" top shelf "" uh i thinks not . tasted very watered down and i decided to limit myself to one at that price to quality ratio . the only part of the experience that was worth while the observing the table sitting next to us . listening to them bicker back and fourth and argue about what they were going to get was quite entertaining ....... i would not recommend going there for anyone there is plenty of other options close by that will leave you satisfied"
5,"just your typical warehouse club right ?   i guess that depends on your definition of typical .   sam 's club has hours just for buisness members starting at 7:00am .   you can also fax in or go online and have them shop for you .   all you do is go in a pay for it . 

 they have a few membership levels- business , gold member and premium .   the premium level you earn 2 % back on all your purchases .   they do give you two cards for the price that you pay , so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card . 

 in addition to electronics , photo lab , optical center , bakery , meat department , they also have a little know "" clearance "" section at each sam 's .   you just have to know where it is .   also when they are clearancing out merchandise , the price will end in a "" 1 "" .   most common is .71 or .81 .   i have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for .71 a bag , and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret . 

 they do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves .   they also will give cookies to children . 

 my boys also love the cafe where they get their "" pizza and drink please . ""   their menu has changed   a lot lately though and i am not sure if i like it .   prices are very reasonable though . 

 they also have gasoline pumps outside which if you know your prices can be a good thing ! 

 if you are not satified with your membership , you can cancel at anytime and they will prorate your membership refund .   their refund policy is really good as well ."
5,"i 've done the shabu fondue more times than i can count !   usually , i order a cheese fondu for myself , and my main man gets a shabu dish .   they both apply the same concepts ... dip something fresh into something very hot and cook it yourself with long sticks .   mm !   i 've tried all the cheese fondues , and the swiss is my favorite .   that smell is unforgettable .   i 've tried all the shabu sauces too , and they 're all pretty strong , so they season those boring vegetables right up .   the cocktail menu should not be over - looked .   the caramel apple martini is the best ! ! !   now the chocolate fondue ....   oh it 's so good !   they serve it with marshmallows , fruit and even a slice of cheesecake to dip in !   for a very small price , you can also add a shot of liquor .   ( i personally always add a shot of bailey 's to add some flavor . )   this is a perfect date restaurant , and it 's not bad for groups either .   the dcor is pretty rad too .   the portions are healthy , but it only works if you end the dinner with the chocolate ..."
3,"3.5 stars ! i must say , i 'm a total fan of their zipps golden wings ! got ta love their reverse happy hour ! ordering their wings on medium is smart move , their wings are already so flavorful and sweet , that its a shame to go any hotter , since you 'll mask the inherent , crisp , and juicy flavor . i 'd say pass on the fish tacos , and if you 're in a burger move , order the jalapeno burger . sampled their beer , not bad ! 

 breakdown : 
 zipps golden wings ~ a must get ! 
 fish tacos ~ yawn ... 
 sweet potato chips ~ could do again ! 
 jalapeno burger ~ delish ! 

 overall , this is a chill spot with your better than average bar food !"
5,"love this place , food is very well portioned , and yummy .   i really love the endless selection of bottled drinks offered .   must try if your craving a soda different from the normal selections offered .   but , they do have the standby soda selections available as well .   stop in , burgers have some crazy combinations to try ."
3,"i am a big fan of chicken and waffles and i will try it just about anywhere it is served .   i especially love it in the morning ; when everyone else is ordering a light breakfast , expect me to go for the fried chicken . 

 lo - lo 's was just alright for me .  

 i liked the chicken , but i was not fond of the waffles .   they were a little too ... thin ?   light ?   i dunno how to describe it , but i like my chicken and my waffles to have a little crunch .   and there was kind of an interesting taste to the waffles .   i ca n't put my finger on the flavor . 

 i liked the atmosphere okay , but i probably wo n't be back . 

 i know mrs. white 's golden rule cafe is not for everyone , but honestly i prefer the feel there .   it feels less "" affected "" by its customers , i guess .   for some reason i am finding it hard to come up with the words here , but lo lo 's feels like it is the more popular cousin of mrs. white 's ... you know ... the one with the letter in football . 

 anyway , i am glad lo - lo 's is thriving ...   maybe i will try the scottsdale location sometime to see if they have a different spin on things ."
4,"the first time was so good , we had to come back !   the peach creme brulee pancakes wowed my partner both times ... something totally addicting about the crunchy edges .   their daily dose hash is a delicious blend of sweet potatoes and onions , with so much more , making me wish i had the recipe .   the omelets are good , it 's just that i want them to be better , to the point where i have to have them again .   both the caprese omelet and the bacon omelet tasted like the listed ingredients were put into the omelet .   that is different from making the combination of ingredients to a whole delicious oneness .    i 'm going to go for the french toast next time .   the service the first time was a 10 + out of 10 , with the 7 am server being very friendly , very helpful and made the whole experience even better .   this past weds morning , it was good , nice , perfect service and friendly ... about a 9 .   i really like this place and i 'm going to go back a few more times to find the best dish ."
4,"cracker barrel is the antithesis of the trendy la or san francisco breakfast establishment .   they feature old - fashioned southern breakfasts with biscuits , gravy and grits plus lots of other choices .   this a very well - run chain of all company owned restaurants .   well - trained staff , quick service and meals served exactly as ordered .   the execution at cracker barrel is excellent .   while some may not like the food style , i enjoy it on occasion .  

 our breakfasts were great and everything was served hot .   very reasonable prices .   my only quibble was that the coffee is only ok ."
2,"so , yesterday morning , i actually had a prego craving .   i was in the mood for a smoothie for breakfast .   my traditional early morning oatmeal or yogurt breakfast was not going to do .   baby wanted something else .  

 i head on over to this jack - in - the box , which is close to work .   i pull up , order my strawberry banana smoothie , and am promptly told that the "" machine is broken "" .   uh ... well that sucks !   i pull up to the window and the person tells me that the machine is leaking ( at least i think that 's what he said ) .   but would be about 10 minutes and it would be up and running .  

 now knowing the smoothie issues i had this morning , i do nt think that the machine was broken .   the product just was nt ready yet ."
4,"they had me at baked . goat . cheese .    the appetizers were phenomenal , we got the bake goat cheese that came with their freshly baked brick oven bread and my bf got the romaine salad with fuji apple & bacon .   but the baked cheese was by far the better of the two . 

 main courses also did n't disappoint we ordered the white fish and hanger steak .   i only had a bite of the fish so i ca n't speak that much to it , the bf enjoyed it .. it had too much lemon in the sauce for me , but i hate lemon flavoring so it 's probably better to take his word for it !    the steak had this amazing sauce that accompanied it that added such a nice flavor to compliment the steak .   both entrees were pretty good size portions , especially after appetizers . and we also split a side of sweet corn polenta that we could n't finish 

 the actual restaurant its self is very open , there is an outside covered patio and a smaller patio for the bar that 's out in the open .  

 valet only , complementary 

 sat night wait time : approx 20 mins 

 clientele : on sat night we had a big table of your typical scottsdale cougars , average couples and groups ranging from mid 20s to 60s and a bachelorette party of 4 girls who were barely 21 ( not the typical place for a bachelorette party )"
4,"i 'm not sure if safeway is a national thing ( let 's just say i 've never seen one of these babies in manhattan ) , but it 's definitely needed in phoenix and tucson . 

 i would drive around the city , looking at all the strip malls and low - end manicure chop shops and wonder , "" where the hell do people go grocery shopping ? "" and while trader joe 's is great , i 'd be hard - pressed to do all of my shopping there . 

 so thank god for safeway , right ? although safeway is generally a little more expensive than other grocery stores , you can pretty much get anything you need there . this particular location was so clean it was beaming ! or was that just me ? 

 it had everything you 'd expect from a safeway -- from a lovely floral department to a mini - starbucks to a sizeable deli counter . 

 yay for safeway and chain shopping !"
4,"nice views of south mountain , lots of elevation changes and some tricky par 3 's make this a very solid muni and probably the toughest in town .  

 first my two complaints : the chipping area should have a few more holes with a slightly larger green , and the neighborhood is atrocious .  

 aguila has four features not often found at municipal golf courses : 
 1 ) you need to drive the ball well to score well here .   from a lot the tee boxes , the driving area often looks smaller than it is ; so , confidence with the big stick is key .  
 2 ) absence of generous flat lies in the fairway ; even if you drive the ball well , you are not always rewarded and are sometimes faced with side - hill lies .  
 3 ) very tough holes # 9 and # 18 .   hey , i like to score low as much as the next guy , but the thing about city courses is that they often give you easy closing holes with a good birdie chance ; not the case here .   rated 3 and 2 handicaps respectably , # 9 and # 18 take advantage of the same water hazard ( similar to the closing holes at karsten @ asu ) and put in play some penal , deep fairway bunkers that require precision drives and good approach shots .   # 18 plays 470 yds+ from the tips , so if you hit a bomb , you still do n't have a wedge in your hand .  
 4 ) two true risk / reward par 4 's - both with water , both greens are drivable from the tee .   # 8 is not a guaranteed birdie from the greenside bunkers , but they 're a good bailout .   # 17 is longer and is a slightly more daunting drive with a more generous bailout option to the right , these are great holes . 

 a tip : 
 take advantage of the par 5 's ; all but the last one is reachable in two ( at least , that 's been my experience ) .   there are only two par 3 's that i would consider good birdie chances ( # 13 and # 16 ) , so if you can roll in a few putts , you 're set . 

 go past tent city , drive further south towards south mountain , and you 'll find a nice municipal course in south phoenix ."
4,"great ambiance , good food .   my husband and i had the southwest benedict and eggs benedict , both were delicious .   i do wish the eggs were a bit more runny and the food was warmer , but the presentation was beautiful ."
4,"blue saguaro has been doing the same menu of breakfast sandwiches ( seriously delicious - toasted sourdough drenched in salty butter , egg over medium , crispy bacon and melty american but not kraft cheese ) and lunch sandwiches & salads for over 10 years .     there 's a reason that it has n't really changed :   it works . 

 the lunch menu has specialty vs regular sandwiches .    most of the specialty are loaded up with sandwich fixings you 're not going to get in a chain shop - cream cheese , sprouts , avocado that was n't spread on thinner than mustard .    the bread is bakery quality and there 's a decent selection .    the ambience is non existent , but when you 're grabbing lunch on the run it really does n't matter .     

 they are super fast , but that may be because i always tip a buck .    :)"
5,i love love barrio cafe . the food is amazing and it is very cute and artsy .
5,"i 'm a pho snob , my hitlist is impressive . in olympia , i ate pho literally every single day . test me , wannabe purists ... 

 nam sao is the best . the guy always working and seeming to make the food is so quick and super sweet . great service , my drink never goes empty , and the table is set in traditional pho - joint style : a metal caddy with spoons , forks [ ... ] , chopsticks , napkins , and all the delicious condiments . 

 the menu is enormous , so if you happen to be in the mood for something other than their glorious , never - watered - down noodle soup , you can try something else . the spring rolls , i love them . the boba tea is great too , i 've had it thicker and more rich at pho hoa in oly but i like the less creamy variety served at nam sao . 

 fast service , cheap filling meal , wonderful server .. i literally can not think of anything bad to say about nam sao , except it 's so small it 's kind of hard to find if you 're new to the spot . just go to the right of fry 's and you 'll see this little piece of heaven with its lights on , welcoming you in ."
4,"the ambiance of this place is pretty great .   i made the comment while we were having diner that it would be a great place for a first date .   that way , if it is awkward , at least there is plenty to look at to make the time pass .   the food was pretty good for the price .   the service was also great .   i 'd happily go back again ."
5,"the quintessential brewery with a wholly fantastic kitchen . best spinach artichoke dip in the valley , period . from fried to gourmet four peaks has it all . beerbread sandwiches are always excellent , fish and chips , bavarian pretzels , french fries , daily specials , i really have n't had an item that i did n't like ! the weather is perfect right now for a sunny patio lunch or fresh air dinner . 

 let 's not forget the beer . my favorites are the oatmeal stout or the peach . their peach beer is legendary with low sweetness and a crisp refreshing taste . if you think cider is too sweet but like fruity flavor , this is your beer . the oatmeal stout is thick and hearty with no bitterness . seasonal beers abound , pumpkin porter in the fall , i 've seen an orange blossom , belgian white , barleywine , etc . 

 parking close can be a challenge on weekend nights , best to ride your bike if you 're close enough .

 just go there already !"
5,i recently had sunscreens installed in my entire   home by cc sunscreens .... i did research and found cc had the best prices ... carl the owner was amazing .... he came to measure the day after i called .   he answered all of our questions .   he gave us a great price and in less than a week the screens were professionally installed .   the screens are not only of the highest quality - they look great and make our home look brand new .   we noticed an immediate difference in the coolness of each room -    and we look forward to saving on our energy bill too !   we ca nt thank cc sunscreens enough -    they are simply the best !
3,"went here with an indian friend so i ca n't tell you what i ate , but it was tasty . we went 5:15pm on a thursday and it was pretty empty , but as the night progressed more and more people filled the place out . 

 they do have a lunchtime buffet but not sure the price or quality of food , but if it 's anything like the dinner we had ... its worth checking out ."
2,"i was elated when i searched yelp for places to eat near my office and found culvers . i ate there two days in a row last week , and ordered the follwing : 

 bacon butter burger , lettuce style - so disappointed . i had high expectations for a burger cooked in butter . while not terrible , this is not even comparable with in - n - out . 

 chicken fingers - decent , although i 've been spoiled by shane 's bbq tenders which are made in house . i 'm assuming culver 's came frozen in a big bag and then were deep fried . still , pretty good for fast food . 

 green beans - not cooked nearly enough for my liking , forced down several fork - fulls then threw the rest away . 

 would only visit again if co - workers dragged me along . i 'm sure i would have a different view of the place if i were in glutton mode chomping on the custard and french fries ."
4,"wings + beer + football = love 

 i am such a girly girl 99 % of the time but come fall , i sort of turn into a dude ..... 

 this is not my most favorite place to catch the game , but a good alternative when i want to mix it up or my team is on a bye week . good selection of boneless wing flavors . 

 oh god , just writing this makes me yearn for the season to begin ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
3,i feel as though this is strictly a local central phoenix bar .   anyone from out of town probably would nt appreciate it as much as a local would .   before i started coming here i heard it was a tranny bar which it definitely is .   however besides weekends you will only see one or two hanging around .   its karaoke is almost alwasy extremely busy which leads to long wait times to sing but its alright because the people there are pretty friendly .   the only two complaints i have is ( first ) the occasional scummy person that comes in that just got out of jail or is high on drugs .   i do wish they would do a better job at kicking these people out .    my second complaint is the very small and usually dirty restroom .   i like this place because i know the bartenders and the people that frequent this bar .   others might not be able to appreciate it as much .
3,"went here for dinner on a saturday night .   put our names in ... and only had to wait about 30 min . not too bad . the bar was a little too crowded to wait there , so we went a couple of doors down to pass our time . 

 on to dinner ... we had a great server .   he was super friendly , nice and was vocal with his opinions .   i would love to tell you that all of his reccs were spot on ... but they were n't . 

 we started with the pretzels and the cheese fondue . delish .   i went halfsies with my friend and we shared the prime rib sammie and the shrimp caesar salad .   the prime rib sammie was mediocre .   the beef was n't flavored at all , and when we got the fries , they were cold .   hot plate , cold food .. not a good sign . 

 we did get fresh fries , i did n't finish my half , and moved on to the salad .   the salad was good , but not great . 

 all in all , i would go for a drink and some apps , but would n't really want to eat dinner here again .   i may have just ordered wrong ... but two meh things do it for me ."
4,"i do n't remember shopping at this location prior to the remodel . 

 i can see myself shopping here much more often in the future .   i 'm already thinking about how much it sucks to shop in the summer when it 's 110 - but covered parking ? ! ?   oh , yeah , i 'll be there in the summer . 

 nice and clean , easy to shop , wide aisles , no clutter in the end caps .   so easy to shop this store . 

 went in today for an advertised price on chicken that we were planning on having tonight .   asked the meat guy if there was any more chicken left .   was told that they were sold out .   i told him that the reason we came to his store was because of the price and we were planning on eating the chicken tonight with dinner guests .   i asked if he could sub something , and he said , "" sure , no problem ! ""   friendly , helpful , super easy . 

 i also mentioned that the last time we came in , i bought something with a manager special sticker on it but was charged the regular price .   the customer service guy refunded my money with no questions !   awesome . 

 great store , nice selection of bulk items , fresh produce , large service deli , in house bakery with some incredible looking treats , clean ..... 

 i 'll definitely be shopping at bashas !   as if i could rave anymore , it 's a locally owned business !"
5,"these dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand . they are honest and very smart . they do n't take my insurance and i still go there ( lets face it , dental insurance does n't reimburse much , so it 's only like a $ 15 difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning ) . i would never go anywhere else !"
3,"i 've gotten lunch take out here a few times . the only thing i 've tried is the drunken noodles . while i think they are pretty decent , i have been having serious issues getting the right spicy - nes . the first time i got them , i asked for level 3 spicy . their spice meter goes from 0 - 5 . i love love hot and spicy thai food , however these noodles were practically inedible . yet , they were so delicious at the same time i devoured the entire thing . and i felt like i was going to die later , as my stomach felt like a fishnet stocking ... 
 the second time i ordered them i asked for level 2 spicy . this time they were not spicy at all . at all ! ! they were so bland . i mean , they still tasted good , but were missing that drunken noodle kick ! so , at this point i do n't know what to do . obviously every cook there must have a different idea of what each number means . 
 the last time i ordered from here , i simply said drunken noodles . i did n't specify a spicy level . i figured maybe this would give me the perfect in between spicy that i so desired ! well , when i got them , they were more bland than the level 2 . and tasted kinda weird . 
 i will give them another try as they are right across the street from my work , and i hope we can work out our spicy issues ! 
 4 stars for the service , they 're really friendly here 
 2 stars for the food , until we can work out our issues 
 and 4 stars for the convenience !"
4,"of all the dairy queens i 've been to in my life in ca , tx and now az , this is the nicest and cleanest location i 've been to . i guess that 's what happens in awhatukee . 

 the staff is fast when you order inside and also when you order through the drive thru . 

 i could eat chicken finger baskets and blizzards all the time ! i 'm happy to live so close to this location and enjoy all the wonderful treats this place has to offer ."
5,one of the best restaurant in town . i have been there few times and they really manage to wow me every time ! the owner if nice and friendly and is really on top of things . the service is great and the food is amazing ! we are going again this saturday and i ca n't wait to taste their new years eve menu . happy new year :)
5,"i see a lot of four stars ... perhaps i 'm too generous with my five stars . i 'm a giver . 

 attended a party for georgie on friday night and had a great time . 
 easy to find , easy to park , easy to get a drink . 

 plus- hey they have the same turbo nozzle a / c vents that i have in my home . i could live there . exposed brick ? me too ! felt right at home . 
 i love the way they display their art , i 'm assuming from local artists . 

 i would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking . however , no problems there - thankfully . :)"
2,"very disappointed ! ! 

 i picked this place because of the reviews that i 've read here .   i feel compelled to give my 2 cents worth . 

 we started out with jalapeno hushpuppies along with their remoulade .   the pups were very tasty ( good start ) . 

 for our main course , we ordered the fried green tomato salad to share , my wife ordered the gumbo with a side of fried okra , and i ordered the fried catfish with double okra on the side . 

 the lag time between our pups and meal was long ...... outrageously long .   when they finally brought our meal , my wife did n't get her okra .   they explained that it would take a few more minutes .   keep in mind , my plate had okra so i guess they must have forgot about hers .   it was no less than 10 minutes before they brought hers out .  

 when we finally received our meal the bartender apologized for the wait and explained that everything they have is fresh breaded and not frozen which is why it takes longer .   i can understand how fresh breaded takes longer but you should find a way to do it faster or take it off the menu if it 's going to logjam your kitchen . 

 all this being said , even after the wait , if the food was good i would be writing a positive review right now .   the problem is , the food was just so so .   the okra had no flavor and was not fully cooked to a nice crisp crust .   my catfish flavor was ok but the breading was pretty thick .   my wife 's gumbo was a little bland .... almost like the roux was a little weak . 

 i really wanted to like this place .   after our first experience , i wo n't likely go back ."
2,"i 'll put it this way -- this place is not worth $ 55 for lunch for two . 

 two burgers , an order of fries , a manhattan ( $ 10 ) , a beer = $ 55 with tip . nice little spot , but hard to justify the cost . 

 the burgers were decent but not rave - worthy , the glass seemed underfilled with the manhattan - though what was there was tasty . 

 if you like over - spending , this place is good . if you 're more value oriented , skip it ."
2,"i am one of those people that talk crap about gordon biersch behind its back but i 'm nice to its face . i go there and continue having expensive yet mediocre meals , but like i just said- i go there . my boyfriend asked me once "" why do it to yourself when you do n't enjoy it ? "" i do n't know . maybe i 'm a masochistic eater . actually , i 'm just very agreeable and i work super closeby . and if i did n't go there i would just walk over to whole foods and spend a zillion dollars on a goulash - y takeout container that i do n't even like after i pay for it . for me , lunch is more about getting out and doing something else for an hour a day . if someone wants to go to gb i will happily tag along and probably eat , even though i know i wo nt like it . at least there 's not much harm in that , except to my wallett ! ps- lori is the nicest , sweetest server / bartender ever and chatting with her makes up for the crappy food !"
2,"what a shame this place is doomed . from a flavor perspective , i have never found such an interesting asian / fusion style of food in a quick - serve setting . the food is remarkably rich and spicy , it 's really refreshing to see a mass - market place be so bold . being so deeply impressed initially , i really , really wanted to like this place . i have since given it about three or four tries . yeah , not so much . 

 first of all , i 'm not sure whether it 's the quality of the meat , the parsimonious manner in which it 's cut or some combination of the two , but their meat is always tough and stringy . when its breaded , the breading is inevitably chewy and hard because the meat inside the breading is so insubstantial that all the moisture gets sucked out in the frying process . not even the chicken comes in substantial enough chunks to be juicy . 

 the amusing thing is , what made me like this place at the outset was the delicious sauces . you 're enjoying the sauces so much you can easily overlook how crappy the meat is . alas , that will only take them so far , as time and time again you are reminded of the crappy meat as you are compelled to floss vigorously . 

 portions are another issue . they 're too small for the price . instead of takeout containers overstuffed with rice and entrees , grandma - sized portions are stingily arranged on a small plastic plate . i never have a problem finishing my entire meal and i always wish there was more . 

 i think pick up stix has a bit of an identity crisis . on the one hand , they want to be pei wei , all flashy stainless steel and fancy real estate . on the other hand , come on folks , it 's takeout faux - chinese ( "" pick "" "" up "" - see what they did there ? ) . the best takeout faux - chinese is always known for generous portions at low prices . at pick up stix , you unfortunately get neither . 

 the patronage reflects my opinion about the place each time i go : it 's always nearly empty . i really do n't expect it to last . that 's a shame , i really will miss the unique flavor profiles ."
4,"wow , this was one of the best dinners i have had in a long time . i definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that i have an entree that knocks my socks off . for me , this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce . my husband was surprised that i ordered this , since i do n't like mushrooms , and luckily for me , the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce . the gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy . i felt like i was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread . omg . we also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband 's . they were just okay to me but overall , were decent . we also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that i really liked . we each had a glass of wine . our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before i ordered it . good thing i did because i did n't like it . the server asked what kind of wine i liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which i enjoyed . overall , before tip , our bill was $ 50 . very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine . 

 this place is extremely small inside with 4 - 6 small table inside and 3 - 4 tables on their patio . there were two servers and on a busy fri night , service was slow . but they were very nice and apologetic , so i gave them a break . i noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space . i was very impressed . i can not wait to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing ."
5,"this place is so unique ! i was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in july , but i wo n't hold that against them ! 

 this bar / boxing ring / vintage store / food truck / soda fountain is super awesome ! my cousin took me here a few years ago and since then it 's been a place that i always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown . the drink list is pretty extensive , with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars . you definitely get a good sized drink ! the beers are cheap , the food is so - so . i think it 's a bit overpriced , so i 'd recommend eating somewhere else beforehand . 

 the boxing ring is random , but i 've seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor , and that is a sight i 'll never regret seeing . some nights they have karaoke , which i 've chosen to partake in a few times . i 've seen dj 's there on the weekends , and i really like how they switch up the music genre each time . sometimes it 's rap , others rockabilly and oldies . on tuesday nights they do free swing dancing lessons and i 've been really wanting to try that ! 

 i love the vintage feel to the place and am surprised it 's not packed all the time !"
4,"i came here with a friend who has been here many times and recommended it .   i was n't disappointed .   first , we came during the lunch rush and it was busy .   however , we were still seated immediately and served by a friendly waitress quickly .   the food then came out in about 5 minutes !   i had the rib tip plate , and it was very good .   my friend had the pulled pork sandwich which was also good .   it 's out off the beaten path but worth the trip .   when you pull into a place out in a strange location , and it 's packed ?   good sign ."
4,"everything i have tried here is great .   prices are very reasonable . few things are over $ 9 and many are about $ 6 . 

  love the shrimp fried rice with a very fair amount of medium size shrimp . 

 appreciate that they deliver and our fast for only a $ 1 fee .   they have a wide delivery area also so at home or work i can order .  

 i highly recommend you try their food . they say it 's new york style . i just know its darn good !   every month i order from them a couple of times ."
5,"i do love rum and should review the rum bar separately but both the rum bar and the breadfruit restaurant are equally awesome ! 

 great recommendations from the waiter ... brown stew chicken and jerk chicken are really good ... really spicy on the jerk chicken but that s somewhat expected and perfect for me ! i 'll take my plantains baked over fried any day ! so good ! really great place to go for not so typical food ! 

 the entire place is quite small in a perfect intimate way .   their seems to be a lot of pride in the menu , environment and service , which is rare to see in restaurant employees . not to mention a perfect location ... very walkable to other nearby bars and easy to make a whole night of downtown phoenix !"
5,"from the moment i walked into the lobby the staff displayed a level of professionalism that you do n't get to see everyday . each staff member that i came into contact with gave me a handshake and said , "" welcome to our business "" . i do n't normally enjoy going to the dentist , but this has been the complete opposite . they made me feel very comfortable and confident that i was going to be happy with my experience , and i was !   so i set up an appointment for my 9 year old son on the way out . since then we have both been in to have work done . my son need one filling and he took it very well , then trotted off to school like nothing ever happened . i started with a deep cleaning from bobbie lynn tucker , rdh .   she was very nice and personable , did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth , not to mention gentle . i was never in any pain either during or after the procedure .   my following visit was with dr. brittian , dds .   i needed a few fillings and i am very pleased with his work . again gentle and quick .   my teeth look beautiful and feel wonderful . they were great with explaining all the costs and have cool perks like a rewards program .   i also liked the glass back wall that gives the patient a private calm view of the outdoors . the flat screens are cool too , but my only complaint is that when i asked quite seriously if they could change the channel , ( i dislike sport shows a lot ) they were not going to budge . that might be something they want to work out . other than that i really would recommend   them to everyone ."
3,"i like the lunch better than the breakfast at "" first watch "" , which is a bit ironic i suppose . perhaps it should be named second watch ? 

 but on to what i do like ... 
 the "" not guilty your honor "" veggie wrap is good . it comes with a side of hummus , fruit and potatoes . big meal ! 
 the "" burrito vera cruz "" breakfast burrito was pretty good . the vera cruz sauce is a mixture of salsa and hollandaise . i 've never had it before trying it here and it was actually pretty tasty ! 
 mango iced tea is good ! and they 'll give you some to go if you ask ! 

 somethin about the potatoes just does n't cut it for me though ... and as i mentioned earlier , the breakfast just is n't my favorite . i just do n't dig their omelets much . 

 sign up for their email club to get a buy 1 get 1 free meal coupon . 

 note : if you 're vegan , order the veggie wrap and substitute avocado for the feta cheese . get a side of salsa too ."
3,"i do n't get the hype , but then again i am not a regular . 

 the beer selection is top notch , the sandwiches are worth the prices , the cheesecake really should n't be drowned in chocolate syrup but who cares , it really is a nice people watch place . i appreciate the well composed menu and not much more can be said . it has reliable service and sandwiches , hipsters and good beer . the lack of surprises make it a good place to take out of towners to see downtown and introduce people to first fridays if you wanna brave potential waits , noise levels , and lack of parking on busy nights ."
5,"az 88 is a great date location .   the atmosphere is excellent - always an artistic display , usually great music .   if my parents ever make it out here from wisconsin , i 'm definitely taking them to az 88 .   the view of the scottsdale mall is really cool , and the proximity to a number of the "" old "" old town bars is really convenient .   the food is reasonably priced , with most sandwiches and dishes right around $ 10 .   they have a good sized bar selection , with some really interesting imported beers .   i would absolutely recommend the az 88 sandwich if you enjoy buffalo sauce , and it 's really hard for me to not order the little crackers with onions and bacon on them ( even despite disliking bacon ! ) ."
4,"this is one of very few east valley theaters that has online ticketing through fandango . the auditoriums have true stadium seating , and the chairs are spacious , and comfortably recline . the arm rests are movable , so you can snuggle with your honey while watching a movie . the picture quality is amazing ! ! ! i only wish this theater offered a military discount , like it 's tucson cinemark counterparts ."
5,"we went to this place for my birthday , wanting to try out something new . we 'd never had ethiopian food and we were very adventurous . be warned , we had a gps and we had a very hard time finding it , it 's tucked away in a little corner ! 

 once we found it and stepped inside , we were definitely wow'd ! the waiter answered our questions about the food , and suggested that if we really want the ethiopian experience , to try out the strictly vegan combo . we ordered tikil gomen , misir watt , kik misir watt , gomen watt , shuro watt , and the dubba . we fell in love with the shuro and the misir watt . the shuro is chickpeas in a cinnamon / spicy sauce , and the misir is spiced lentils . soooo tasty ! even non - vegetarians will enjoy this place , and they do have meat dishes ."
5,"in short - jen rocks ! 

 finding someone i trust to watch my crazy crew is always a bit nerve - wracking .   i came across jen 's pet sitting while searching for options , since i 'm relatively new to the area .  

 i decided to book a consultation with jen to have her meet the furry family and learn more about her and her services .   jen is extremely professional and came ready to take notes and also spent a lot of time getting to know my critters .   it was clear from her interactions with my cats and dogs that she loves animals and really understands them .  

 after having a great experience with jen during the consult i booked her to do visits over a long weekend .   the hubs and i took our dogs along for the trip and jen looked after our cats while we were away . she gave us regular daily updates about our cats while we were gone .   sometimes she sent pictures with her updates which was an added bonus !   jen spent time playing with our cats during each visit which was fabulous . 

 i always know i 've found a wonderful petsitter when i come home and my animals are a little disappointed to see me !   we will definitely continue to use jen in the future ."
3,the food was decent .   my friend and i had the meatball sub and marinara chicken sub .   i know this is stereotyping but being served food my real italians i expected more spice and flavor in the food .   the alcohol selection is small but has the essentials ( beer and wine ) . i want to go back and check out the pizzas before i write this place off .
4,"family - run restaurant that serves extremely yummy iraqi food . go up to the register if you want take - out and they will help you figure out exactly what you want . the cook is very friendly and can do extra stuff for you just let him know exactly what you 're looking for . if you 're staying in the restaurant to eat , they have fast service and its always served hot . very good food !"
1,"beware ... use only a credit card so you can stop payment if you need to . ( our sales person encouraged us to pay cash and get a 10 % discount ) .   big mistake ,   any problem you 're on your own ... really ... on your own !   we 've spent over $ 3,000 at this store and it has been a nightmare .   delivery took   weeks longer then our sales person said & our paper work indicated . there was a mistake with the fabric , the paint was mismatched , what was to take 10 days took 3 months .   not a darn thing was handled properly .   every call we made to "" customer service "" was routed directly   back to our   sales person . we went back to the store   in person but there is no mgr , no one except commission sales staff and a voice mail merry go round ."
3,good to know they still have independent films and they chose wisely what to play . unfortunately this location seems to be attracting 40 + yuppies ! i was shocked to see how many middle - aged and even elderly were at camelview . that was a disappointment :/
1,"3 months , 22 emails , 10 plus calls and ( i think ) we have the final refund from budget ! 
 stay clear of budget rental they do not care about customers or resolving their monumental mistakes !"
4,"i usually try to stay away from the arizona mills mall . the mall itself has gotten crappier by the minute . now , since i work close by , i was forced to go back to venture to paradise bakery . i honestly did not get my hopes up . 

 since it was lunch time , it was not busy at all . nothing is worse that being on your work lunch , starving , and standing in line . i opted for the chicken walnut sandwich , with a cup of tomato soup . 

 the sandwich was delicious and fresh . the bread was perfect as was the chicken walnut salad . you know ... sometimes chicken salad can get really gross .. slimey .. salty ... yucky . this one was perfect and the walnuts added a delicious crunch . 

 on to the soup . first off , i l - o - v - e tomato soup . it is my favorite . would almost consider taking a bath in it . hehehe ... well , ok maybe not . but this soup rocked my socks off . perfectly creamy , with a hint of smoky flavor , a small drizzle of sour cream and a few crunchy tortilla strips . yum . 

 so , venture there to try the soup but scurry fast and take the food with you . do n't eat there . take it somewhere , where you can have a moment alone with the soup . 

 finito ."
5,i love this place!!!!fun poker 3 days a week!!great food!!!great prices!!!even better people ! ! ! !
5,"stopped back in here today for lunch with arlin b. , robyn n. & mike c.   they 're still delivering the same upscale asian buffet experience here as before , including atmosphere , food & table service that are just tops so it 's "" woohoo "" again for this excellent restaurant ! !      :-)) 

 ( see previous review for more details .   weekday lunch buffet is still $ 11.99/$10.79 sr . )"
3,"i am glad that i remembered this place for brunch this past saturday because it was good food and i love the atmosphere in the area as well .   i went with my bf and we put our name in , got some coffee and was seated quicker than the time the originally gave us , which is great in my book .  

 i had the breakfast burrito with chorizo .   i was nt a fan of it , it was good but not great .   the chorizo really lacked flavor and punch ... maybe i am use to the chorizo i get back home .   my bf had pancakes with ice cream on top of it and it looked amazing and he loved it . 

 i would come back and probably will to try some of there other things .   this is not a place to go to thinking you will get in and out quick , there are almost always people waiting but the walk around old town scottsdale is worth it ."
5,"impossibly good italian deli in the middle of the desert . huge sandwiches on the most incredible bread you 've ever had outside of ny . as someone who ate here 3 times in a 24 hr period , i feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak . ho - ly - shit . easily the most decadent , flavorful cheesesteak i 've had in a very long time - and i live 15 minutes outside of philly . i m still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off . ask for yours on the soft roll . 

 i should also mention the sausage ,   peppers & onion sandwich , which was really good . i suspect they make their own sausage , which elevates them to superstar status in my book . the chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good , and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well . 

 i do nt do cold subs , but the ones i saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty . perhaps i will try their pizza next time i 'm in town ."
3,it 's okay . it 's nothing like san francisco food .
4,"i know that wal - mart gets a bad rap at times , but i need to report how nice they were to me the other day .   i went in there to buy some christmas presents and found everything i needed and went to pay for everything .   i apparently did not take everything off the kyosk of bags and left one package there .   when i got home and these items were not in the back of my vehicle , i went back down there .   they told me to just go and get two more pair of the item i was missing .   i really felt they were so nice in doing that .   thank you wal - mart ."
4,"holy crap thomas is spot on , hilarious .   the first thing i thought when i first walked in this place was "" i 'm feeling mighty little "" .  

 big heavy pieces for sure , dark woods , carved , unique .   you need a big space to show off this stuff .   lots of mexicali knicker knackers .   i still have a few pieces with me here in hotlanta , but it does n't quite fit anymore .... 

 anyone want to buy it ?   shipping is only $ 5,000 ...."
3,"its refreshing to find one - of - a - kind places -- god knows phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic , strip - mall , chains - on - every - corner valley . finding this unique sandwich shop , which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant , is indeed a welcome find . the real estate is limited , so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building . 

 the dining area is mainly indoors , but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot , which is not very scenic . inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased . 

 they serve wraps , bowls and salads . the food has been pretty good , although it did not knock my socks off . i ordered the baja bowl , which is described on their online menu as "" southwestern chicken atop garlic rice , black beans , monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo . "" it was ok , but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks . it could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure , but there were no southwest flavors to speak of . i have done a better job of cooking chicken on my george foreman grill at home . perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor , but i had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor . sour cream was not "" lime "" . there was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl . i would not bother ordering this again -- especially if i have a craving for some southwest food . 

 on another recent visit i ordered a wrap called "" prince of thai 's - spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach , garlic rice , fresh ginger slaw , cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla . "" that had better flavor than the baja bowl . vegetable ingredients were fresh and good . again , i was not very impressed with the chicken chunks . 

 one thing i think that 's a wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups . afterall their slogan is "" healthy food for a hungry planet "" and they have a link for a new restaurant "" green "" for vegan food on their website . for such an artsy , earthy place , i would have thought that 's a wrap would have made more conscious , earth - friendly choices . for that reason and the bland chicken , i give them an average rating only ."
3,"some friends came in so a group of 6 of us went here .   cool little place with good atmosphere , basic and cozy .   wines by the glass were good .   the bread was a bit stale but still pretty decent .   we ordered a variety of things .   the antipasto plate was good with several typical items .   my tomato sausage pizza was good , not great .   needs some spice and flavor .   the halibut over sundried tomato basil risotto with aspargus was very good but the halibut was a little over cooked .   otherwise , most everybody liked the food .   one person ordered a dish and asked for a little spice but it was way too spicy and they basically could n't eat it .   her husband ate it the next day because he could handle the spice but seriously it was way too spicy for most people .   not a bad place , would probably go back but wo n't drive out of the way as the location is a little out there ."
5,"we went to check out pnp for their 2 year anniversary show and were extremely impressed !   space 55 is the most charming space that i never would 've known existed had it not been for this show being promoted on yelp !   the actors were amazing and we really were in awe the entire time we watched this 30 minute film being created right in front of us !   i 'd heard of comedy improv , but movie improv ?   i had no clue ... 

 special shout outs to mark j and jenn h ( our very own phoenix yelpers ) who did an incredible job on saturday night .   congrats again , pnp , on your 2 year anniversary !   i look forward to attending future performances for sure !"
3,the veg burger is fantastic - make sure you ask to try all the different aioli sauces especially with the tots !
5,"yikes ! ! its a good thing that this place it a far drive for me - cuz it could spell trouble . 
 if you ever have a craving for a real delight and want to really ' enjoy a silent moment' ..... try one of their coconut , lemon or dark chocolate cupcakes . honestly i did nt care how many calories are in them .... i was weak in the knees . 
 there is standing room only in this shop   - literally i think my bathroom is bigger -but a big thumbs up for the cupcakes , and kudos on their packaging!!. ( its definitely built into the pricing ! )"
2,"pastrami tasted good , but had a lot of tough tissue , and was near impossible to bite through . rye bread was low - quality . 

 curly fries were tasty . 

 cole slaw was yummy ! really the highlight of the meal . 

 lemon bar was delicious , if a bit subdued . ( i like the lemon to pucker my face ) 

 the brownie was warm and chocolatey , but too many nuts . 

 probably my only visit , unless someone invites me ."
5,"cafe monarch is more than a restaurant - it 's an experience . if i had to put an analogy to this one - i would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show . i was immersed in christopher 's beautiful world and entertained the entire time . 

 as camille h mentioned , this place may not be for everyone . there is no menu provided to pick things from . this is not a place for a quick snack , although , i bet if you asked , christopher would provide it . if you are a picky eater or have food allergies , call ahead of time . but if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients , wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish , you will not be disappointed . 

 i am not sure i would bring my five year old to this place . she would enjoy it , but i think my husband and i will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter . since christopher is a one man show - chef , server , host , story teller , etc . etc , each course takes awhile , and my child 's attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal . 

 for a description of the amazing food we ate , please see camile h 's review . she described everything perfectly . 

 this is my new favorite place in the valley . i ca n't wait to go back ! highly highly highly recommend this experience ! ! !"
4,"ok , not knowing what to expect when walking up to the rc when i saw a courtyard full of people mulling around , i thought a relaxed , quiet meal was shot to hell ! lucky for us , all the peeps walking around ( seeming "" zombie - like "" ) were waiting on pizzeria bianco , the pizza place across the way !   ok back to the review of rc .. i have to agree with francis l .. good sliders , fish was below average but the wedge fries are awesome ! ! the fish itself was ok , but the breading was watery as if steamed from the inside ! i was totally bummed because it had a good flavor .. but was inedible ! the ' tartar ' sauce was another huge hit ! not a creamy sauce but liquidy with tons of cucumber chunks ... the onion rings are worth a try .. and they have a nice horseradish- ranch sauce . 
 we sat inside , nice decor ... you got ta like the english pub look which is fine by me ! we 'll be back for sure ! ! 
 nutshell- nice bar menu , good bar food- great drinks ! ! great people watching spots from front porch area ... defiantly worth repeat visits !"
5,"hands down the best cupcakes in the phoenix market . tammie coe comes in second with the coconut but sometimes it 's not as fresh as it could be at lgo . milk chocolate is great , taste a sprinkle - it 's really chocolate not wax . i had salted caramel it was wonderful . dark chocolate is decadent . i did try the red velvet and it was good but i 'm done trying to understand red velvet . i just do n't get it ."
5,"this is the most progressive , inclusive , welcoming , diverse , intellectually stimulating , public - service oriented church in the valley , if not the west coast .   we 've been to more than a few and can attest to that .  

 pastor jeff not only knows everyone 's name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life .   the congregation is like one big family .   love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church - it 's acted upon .  

 if you 're sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and do n't act what they preach , you 'd better check this one out .   services every sunday at 9:30am ."
4,"probably not the best pizza i 've ever had , but definitely in the top 5 !   had the groupon deal of 50 % off , so that made it even a better experience .   not exactly the atmosphere for a "" date night "" , but the quality of bread / sauce / toppings is fantastic .   if you like specialty beer and pizza , there is no reason not to try this place .   will be returning for sure !"
2,"i went to wildflower looking for a lunch spot that had wifi . i arrived at 11:30 , and noticed every table in the small place was full . it was my first time there , it seemed a lot like paradise bakery ( which is a good thing ) , so i ordered , hoping a table would open up . price was about the same as paradise . by the time my food got there , no tables opened , so i got the food to go . i got home , opened the food , and much to my dismay , it was quite a bit worse than paradise . also , no delicious cookie . next time i 'll just drive up the street a couple miles ."
5,"thanks for helping me to find valley eyecare center , fellow yelpers !   i visited their office as a new patient and knew from the moment i walked in that it was going to be a positive experience .   the receptionist was   friendly , the office was modern and clean , and the wait was super - short ( ~3 mins ) . i was impressed with care that was provided and did n't feel rushed when working with dr. eric clyde or his assistant .   the three words that come to mind when thinking of this office are : professional , prompt , and accurate .   my visit was for a contact lens fitting , so no comment on their frame selection / service ."
4,love abuelos ! best mexican food !

4,"thanks to sara v. i learned about total wine & more through her and when i heard they were opening up locations in phoenix , i was excited . anywho , 6 visits later , i can honestly say i 'm a fan of total wine and moreso than bevmo . i love that there 's a wide selection of wines from all over . my favorites are riesling , moscato , rose , pinot noirs and sparkling wines . yes , i love the sweet kinds . 

 anywho , my most recent visit , had me buying two kinds of rieslings both recommended , a bree and the other one a german riesling . i recently had moscato the night before and loved , it was sweet like apple cider and very flavor , with it 's apple and peach undertones ... simply delish ! the bug juice moscato was yum and elegant . i totally enjoy the selection not just for wines but for beers as well . i like that i can by some hoegardaan for cheap and i like the wine tastings going on . the staff 's helpful and overall i like the layout and the prices !"
5,"i picked up some brownies as holiday treats this year and they did not disappoint ! 

 these are the richest , chocolatiest , moistest , biggest ( 3 "" square ) brownies you will find !

5,"the best gelato ever ... ever ! ! !   yeah i said it .   what ?   seriously , the best customer service i 've experienced since the ' 70s .   by the time i ordered i was nearly full because they encourage customers to try everything - easily 20 different favors to sample and choose from .   my favorites are the dark chocolate , salted caramel , peach champagne , and black cherry .   we 've visited multiple times and have never been disappointed - same quality service and deliciousness every time .   my kids referred them to a friend and he owner gave my kids free gelato on their next visit - they appreciate their customers .   if your looking for your next vice , check this place out !"
4,"anyone who asks , "" are you a vegan to lose weight ? "" should come to green and eat their words . and everything else . 

 in fact , i usually end up at green with non - vegetarian friends because they claim that it 's "" food you can eat that i actually like . "" every dish is addictive , flavorful , saucy , and filling . classic hits include the chicken thai peanut bowl , the singapore tofu bowl ( although the mock meats are a shame to miss out on ) , the vegan bbq chicken sammich ( i just watched a carnivorous friend down this with the delight and voracity of a young velociraptor ) , and then there are the eternally awesome specials . 

 even though you 'll probably be stuffed post - meal ... make room for dessert . it 's mind over matter anyway . order a tsoynami - they 're like mcflurries with vegan ice cream and epic swirl ins . standouts include tsoynamis   filled with anything from frozen chocolate fudge , bananas , kitkats , hazlenut brittle , mint oreos and more . 

 on a another note , this is also the only strictly vegan restaurant in the tempe / scottsdale area with a lively , hip atmosphere . even if you love steak more than anything in the world ( and there are steak po'boys , might i add ) at least stop by for a chocolate chip cookie and check out the awesomeness of the place ."
2,"i have been coming to xtreme bean for several years and it is still a generally good place .   the coffee is average or below , the tea selection is good , the atmosphere is ok but same old . the current staff is incredibly immature and act like children yelling , and even barking , at high decibels .   i 've never seen anything like   it anywhere .   i 'll have to think twice about coming back if this continues ."
4,"this place is great ! i must have passed it a million times without knowing that it was tucked away in the complex . the sushi was awesome , the drinks were very reasonabally priced , we loved the decor and the atmosphere was very nice , kinda romantic if you are seated in the back away from the sushi bar . the service was great ! we will definitely be going back ."
4,such a great oriental market !   unusual fresh produce and aisles of every kind of noodle and sauce .   fresh fish .   the only disappointment is we read on yelp that they had sushi grade fish and they do not .   boo !   the only thing they had was frozen smoked eel ( unagi ) .   we will definitely shop there often and it was a fun trip for the grandkids-
5,"a hole in the wall in south phoenix .... 

 i order : the "" betty boop "" - a plate with 1 waffle and 1 fried chicken breast .   add a huge mason jar of the sweetest & reddest koolaid ( or sweet tea - depending on my mood ) and a side of grits drowning in melted butter and i 'm a happy girl . 

 their red velvet cake is also amazing . 

 i know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but it 's really interesting and satisfying - with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken .... yum yum .  

 it 's one of my family 's favorites ! ! !  

 try it ! ! ! !"
4,"i was super excited to find a place in arizona that has vegetarian pho ! 

 the service was just mediocre .   it met basic requirements without any friendliness . 

 very cost effective= cheap ."
5,"recently i had the pleasure of eating at this great new iron chef jose garces restaurant . pulling up to the front entrance to the restaurant my girlfriend and i were greeted by extremely nice doorman who valet our vehicle for us . we were a bit concerned that we were going to get wet from the rain on this day , but thanks to the valet service the hotel & restaurant provide we stayed warm and dry ! now i must say we were taken back from the decor inside the restaurant ... it was spectacular ! ! the way the restaurant is decorated just puts a smile on your face ! also , it gives you a feel for iron chef jose garces personality which seems to be light and fun . the food is absolutely amazing ! ! we split the "" ignacio "" nachos which have black beans , tomato , queso mixto , jalapeño , chile de arbol , and radish , and the barbbacoa "" costillas "" berkshire pork spare ribs , chipotle - cider mustard bbq they were tender , juicy , and delicious ! we tried the house margarita the "" distrito "" and the white "" mexican sangria "" both were spectacular ! ! i have never heard of a white sangria before .. but wow it was amazing ! all of the employees we encountered were extremely nice , knowledgeable , and sincere . this restaurant will definitely stay on my regular to do list ! thanks to everyone who gave us a wonderful experience ! ! !"
1,"the food was okay but the portion sizes where the smallest i have ever seen .... and i am a regular to fox restaurants .  

 babbo is much better ."
5,"i had an amazing dinner tonight at quiessence .   when we made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything ; we were , so when we sat down we were given 3 glasses of complimentary champagne .  

 we started with a plate of three delicious cheeses .   they have a huge selection of cheeses , probably about 20 , and we chose a goat , a smoked gouda and a jack .   all delicious and served with crostini , perfectly melt - in - your - mouth bartlett pears , pecans , honey and quince paste .   great start . 

 our next course we shared two salads - an octopus carpaccio and field green salad .   both good . 

 my main course was amazing .   it was heritage turkey with mashed potatoes and carrots .   i ate every bite .   so flavorful .   my dad had a beef sirloin that was perfectly cooked and delicious with a side of fingerling potatoes .   my mom got swordfish .   it was not cooked properly when it first came out , but they promptly corrected the problem , so i ca n't fault them for that . 

 the ambience was great including a live but not distracting singer and a warm crackling fireplace .   in addition , i want to give big props to the servers for knowing everything about the food they served .   she knew where the fish was caught , how the beef was raised , what certifications the turkey farm had achieved .   it is great to be able to get those kind of answers with zero attitude when you ask the question . 

 my only reservations would be 1 ) definitely is "" slow "" food , maybe a tad too slow but so delicious it was worth it and they said they were short staffed and 2 ) i 'm not sure i buy that their seafood is sustainable .   they served atlantic cod and atlantic swordfish .   my understanding is that both of these fish stocks are pretty severely depleted .   i asked and was told that the fisherman they buy from are committed to sustainable methods , but i 'm not sure ( personally , for me , at least ) that it is possible to sustainably fish a stock that is in danger . 

 all in all though , a fantastic night and i ca n't wait to return !"
3,the phoenix hooters is directly opposite the sheraton downtown hotel where i was staying . was really hungry and did n't want to eat at the hotel so decided to give hooters a try . hooters girls are always a nice touch . i really liked this location since there was a lot of outside seating . the food is what you expect from hooters . i had the pulled pork sandwich with fries . it was good but then i was very hungry . food quality was good and arrived quickly . ca n't ask for anything more ! ! hooters girl was also cute ! ! i would come back with a crowed of guy for a drink and burger . prices are very reasonable .
5,fresh bread .... awesome beans ! ! ! raspado ... tostitos ! ! ! !
5,"i work across the street and love me some hava java . the morning crew is very friendly , and the coffee is great . i am a big fan of the swiss chocolate blend , ( or any of the flavored blends for that matter ! ) they are really flavorful without tasting at all artificial . i buy hava java beans and brew them at home , but when i stop in for a quick cup of coffee i always have a good experience ."
3,"i ca n't help but feel the same sentiment as nathan s. - i sort of feel bad giving this place only 3 stars with all the other rave reviews . 
 
 let me start with the positives - 
 
 i love love that the place is so small and intimate .   especially in comparison to most valley restaurants that are just cavernous .   and with the european - style seating you have to get friendly with your neighbors .   both of these things make this feel like a good ny restaurant . 
 
 i also love the atmosphere and decor in general .   very authentic spanish , very laid back , not all hip and modern like most restaurants try to be these days . 
 
 the service was extremely friendly , from the hostess to all of the waiters and waitresses and bus boys that came by . 
 
 my husband really liked the sangria ( tinto ) - he said it was n't very strong but tasted great . 
 
 indeed , all of the food tasted very good .   our two favorite dishes happened to be the daily specials - the eggplant barcelona and the turkish custard dessert .   but the tortilla patatas and the gambas and the spinach with garbanzos were all great as well . 
 
 now to the negatives - 
 
 firstly , selection was dreadful all around .   the wine list was very minimal , and the very limited bar did n't help .   and there were only about 8 dishes to choose from .   when i go for tapas , the whole point is having a wide variety of small plates to choose from ! 
 
 every dish was drowned in oil .   literally , bowls of oil .   the food just sat in my stomach afterwards , and i felt like i needed to take a shower to rid myself of all the grease . 
 
 the sizes of the dishes were very inconsistent .   i know it 's tapas , and i love me some tapas , but generally at tapas places i find you could likely split each dish three ways .   the gambas and the spinach were both huge piles that could have been split up to 4 ways .   but then the tortilla patatas was barely large enough to split two ways , and then our two favorite dishes - the eggplant barcelona and the turkish custard - were both smaller than a deck of cards and splitting them just two ways left us each with a single forkful of food .   there was a party of 4 next to us that put in 1 order of the pork tenderloin and the waitress said , "" you should really get 2 or 3 orders of that so everyone can try some . ""   3 orders for 4 people to try it ? ! 
 
 then , right along with the food size is the price .   $ 90 ( incl tip ) for the 4 tapas mentioned above , plus a glass of sangria , 2 glasses of wine , the dessert , and an espresso .   2 of the tapas were one bite per person .   yikes . 
 
 the food , while good , was nothing outstanding .   there was no dish that made me stop and say "" wow , now that is well done . ""   they were solid but not amazing .   ( as opposed to the lomo embuchado at cobras y matadors in la that i was ready to marry and make babies with ) . 

 so all in all , i 'd say a 3.5 star experience , rounded down because it just was n't a 4 for me .   i ca n't help but compare this place to my favorite tapas place in the valley , sol y sombra in the dc ranch , where they have a huge selection of fantastic wine ( and a full bar ) and a huge selection of delicious and much larger portioned tapas for the same price ."
4,"i 've never had a bad meal at z - tejas .   my favorite is the jerk chicken salad , but i 've also had some great scallops there .   the cornbread is always delicious , and they 're famous for their margaritas ."
2,"if you have a family with a lot of little kids , are absolutely happy with your body , and only want to leave your house to change your scenery , this is your place . if you are looking for a great workout , this is not your place . the hours are pretty bad and you have to plan your schedule around them . the cardio machines are good . the variety of weights is okay but they are all over the place . they have a suggestion box , but they do n't take them seriously . the classes used to be good , but now the quality has gone down . the zumba class used to be my favorite , but not so much anymore . they should have different levels , but there is only one and it is slow . there are kids all over the place . i do nt understand what parent would want their 6 year old girl learning to shake her butt , but i ca n't judge , i do n't have a kid . maybe when i have one i would want her to learn to dance low and shake it , so she can be asked to go on mtv . the majority of the classes are in the middle of the day , which is great if you do nt have a job or anything to do with your time . yoga ? there were a couple good instructors , but they are not there anymore . what do you guys do to your instructors ? why do they run away ? why do you make it hard to get a good workout ? i do nt think i am asking for much here , just a place that i can get a good workout ."
5,this is definitely the best indian restaurant in phoenix . the tandoori chicken and aloo tikki wraps are to die for . you can not go wrong with this place !
1,"the service here was awful , we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table . finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks . another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying "" have you guys decided yet on what you want ? "" , uhh yeah ! 
 overall , service was poor and food was just okay . wo n't be going back ."
5,good place to chill with a drink somewhere lowly lit and good live music . all the bartenders are really nice and that 's always rad : )
4,"it finally opened ! the sign has been on the building for at least 3 seasons , maybe more , but the wait was worth it . we needed a breakfast spot in this central area sorely . the order system is like pei wei , line up and order at the counter get a number and sit down . bad news , the wait was long , the good news , the food is great . i guess , i revealed that i 'm impatient and want instant gratification . thank god that they gave me a cup for coffee after we ordered and got our number to pin on the table on those "" alligator clips "" . every time i use those things , i flash back to the early 70 's using those clips for that last toke that then gave the super munchies . 

 coffee , $ 2.50 a cup for a bottomless cup with plenty of choices and in a to go cup . atmosphere ..... very hip look , open ceilings , nice patio , great colors and great sayings on the wall to remind us of cool sayings to remember while we nosh . breakfast came pretty quickly considering how many people were in the restaurant . i had a breakfast burrito that was plump and was plenty of food . i just hoped for more .... maybe those alligator clips reminded me of the munchies of the 70 's . sandra had a cinnamon roll and although i thought it could have been bigger .... she enjoyed and said "" it was fine and filling "" . 

 saw several friends there , all overweight and they said the portions were very satisfying . 

 this is stupid but i love it . the dyson hand dryers in the bathroom . they are the best . i 'll be back for more and they can earn that fifth star i 'm sure ."
4,"this place is great .   they have the best veggie burger - yes veggie burger - that i have probably ever had .   it is spinach based and has chopped jalapenos in it for some kick .   when i buy an entree , my kid eats for free .   so not only is the food good but it 's very fairly priced as well .  

 and much better than the regular big fat greek restaurants around town ."
5,"beautiful hotel , great pool , nice restaurants , fantastic service , fabulous place to stay ."
4,"i stumbled in here craving breakfast because it was very close to the airport and very close to the aloft hotel i was staying at .   yes , i am a tourist and yes , i am from a part of the us where cowboys are not common , so walking into a place full of country western paraphanalia made me smile .   the service was good , the food was delicious , and i walked out with a few good photos .   the coffee was a tad bit weak , but i 'm a starbucks bold drinker , so i do n't hold it against them ."
3,"you know when you make a copy of the original and its not quite the same ? juts a little fuzzy around the edges , not as sharp but usable ? that is how i felt at the new location of market bistro . similar vibe that i enjoy at the original is n't quite as pulled together at this location . maybe the lack of a lounging area or the weird particle board chic tables ? or the fact that every table was dirty except one by the blast furnace ( front entrance ) .. maybe the grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill ? no forks ? i 'm sorry if i sound like a banging on mb .. but these are things that can be improved on . 

 the mr and i shared a salad and a cuban sandwich .. the control freak in me of course got off on the salad making .. this was probably the best salad i ve made to date .. you should be able to patent your creations ! the cuban sandwich was okay .. the ciabatta rolls are so thick and chewy that when you take a bite the toppings sort of fire out the back .. for a cuban sandwich i think it had some sort of asian spice , like cardemom ? ? anyway , the mr did n't like it at all . this being his first time he was confused as to why i went on and on until he took a bite of my patent pending salad , then it all made sense to him . the salads are just so complete and delicious ! 

 i look forward to coming again .. i just hope that they can make a perfect copy of the original or go for a different feel entirely ."
3,"oh , true food . i want to love you . 

 but you make me feel like i 'm eating in a cafeteria . with such a contemporary menu and a staff full of bright shiny faces this restaurant is just a contradiction in form ... the menu and ambience just do n't match . 

 my advice is to sit at the bar . the drinks are well served by pleasant bartenders and do their job , the stools are comfortable , and from that locale you get to skip the experience of having dinner with a room full of strangers right at your elbow ."
5,"this was such a good experience 
 i was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth ache 
 i do n't have health insurance so i did n't think i could afford a dentist 
 friends and family told me to look up a dental school and that s how i found a.t. still 
 i called and they said they accept five emergency patients a day at 1:pm 
 it was 11 am but i did n't care i drove straight there and i was the first patient seen at 1 p.m. 
 it cost $ 15 to be seen , $ 15 for the x - rays , and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavity 

 so they sent me up to oral surgery , it cost me $ 85 to get the tooth extracted 
 i was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fears 
 it did n't hurt at all , i was numbed up and the student did a good job 

 they gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and i have to return next week for follow - up 
 the follow up appointment is free ! 

 totally recommend this place to any and everyone !"
4,"ohhhh , i like , i like ! 

 first of all , if you have n't seen distrito , scope the photos on the website . high - five to the interior designer . from the gold glittery tables to the gumball wall , this place screams fun , energy , and overall a kick - ass atmosphere . 

 i stayed at the saguaro for five nights , so i had plenty of time to get my dinner ( and breakfast ! ) on at distrito . actually , for dinner , i had room service but distrito is where it came from . i was absolutely starving after a long plane ride , so i ordered the chicken tacos , guac , and a plantain appetizer , and it only took about 20 minutes to show up . win . 

 the chicken tacos were really , really good . little corn tortillas , marinated chicken , slaw , radish , and a perfectly - sized slice of avocado . there were three of them and i could only eat two , but they were so well made . the plantain dish was also impressive , and had some black bean puree underneath that balanced out the sweetness of the plantains . the star of the show , however , was the guacamole . tons of lime , zing , and flavor . i ate almost all of it and it was definitely worth it . usually when i have guacamole it 's just so - so and i have to add some spice , but this showed up completely perfect . 

 when i had breakfast , things were also on point . they made me an egg white omelet with tons of vegetables inside , and my co - workers seemed to love other menu items like the pancakes and french toast , as well . if i lived in scottsdale i 'd definitely visit this place a time or two more . consider me a fan !"
5,"if you are looking for a place where the service matches the food , look no further . this family style americanized - italian restaurant was beyond comparison . the staff is very friendly and if you have children , they will well entertained while stuffing their faces with amazing food . from the freshly baked bread to the main coarse , every bite was like a new adventure for my taste buds . they have a wide variety of food but i highly recommend the pasta dishes . your mouth will thank you the moment you take your first bite ."
5,"i 've eatin ' a lot of pizza and can say without worries that mama mia 's is the best i 've had -- consistency , value and great service sets them apart -- they also have the best take out wings in town ! ! ! !"
5,"i 'm so sad i did n't discover the herb box sooner . i went for a girl 's lunch and was blown away - by the decor , the vibe , the view and the food - and this was during the winter . i ca n't wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go - to spot for me . the salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly ! they 're amazing and you 'll get tons of them . the decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and i could seriously move in . 

 if you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of arcadia farms , give herb box a whirl . it 's got the same feel , but more modern . love love love it ."
1,"it 's been a few months since i 've been here , and what a change , not for the better . i usually get the same thing to start with , ceviche and pollo asado . both are usually quite delicious , not this time . 

 the ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it . as if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible . i did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least . now for the tacos . stale taco shells , dried and overcooked chicken , slopped on guac and no pico de gallo . the tacos were so bad i tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo , since they did not put any on , and then i was charged $ 1.00 extra . of course , no manager was anywhere in sight . this place simply does n't care . on the bright side , the margaritas and salsa are still good , but the chips were stale . 

 not only will i not return , but i can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town . i see dozens of new business people every day who stay in scottsdale and they always ask for mexican food , and i 've always said cien agaves . no more ."
4,"came here in a daze after not having slept for a loooong time and flying in to the airport with dad ; reminds me of the nice breakfast diners in chicago , got the combo with turkey sausage ( still greasy -- defeats the purpose ) , eggs ( always the same everywhere ) , french toast ( more white bread , nothing too special but filling ) , coffee .   nice atmosphere and no major problems , would be great for the weekend brunch !"
3,"i 'm happy to report these cows gave their best for me to eat . thank you dear moo cows thank you ! these burgers are meaty goodness . recently i went to a lunch with my bf , her sis and ma on the fly for her b / day since her first choice failed to be open on a sunday afternoon ..... not her fault their site said they would be open . bastards shaking my fist in the air did n't update the site . 
 d o u b l e grrrrr ! i suggested zin since we were in the proximity . 
 so this is my 3rd time at this place . while pricey the portions of everything are large in charge & good . the ingredients are fresh , the meat juicy and the fries are crispy as they should be in my opinion . note to your mother ! do not waste the fat & gym time on the creme brulee shake . it 's nothing more then a fancy name on a regular old vanilla shake . having said that ... i am a creme brulee fan so that may have been it 's downfall . i was expecting greatness and fireworks etc . i got a really good vanilla shake though do n't get me wrong but name it a vanilla shake . do n't market it as a creme brulee shake . how to improve it and bring a tear to my eye ? put a creme brulee hat on it . gimmie the crunchy , sweet i 'm looking for expect and demand . just put something on it to give it with that brulee feel or name it a vanilla shake . the best way to explain my feelings would be to say it was like setting up a date with someone on - line and having them show up and it 's clear they are photogenic but possibly altered a bit and not the hottie in the pics on their profile . it is some one with a great personality and decent looks for sure just not the hottie . still had a good time but my expectations were something else totally . the banana cream pie shake is de - lish and the zin burger a def go . if you want a healthy choice go for the tuna also very good and served perfectly rare . mmmmm mmmm good ."
2,"food was amazing but the service was horrible ! i would suggest to take out do n't dine in . i ordered the eggs benedict , instead of canadian bacon , they put crispy bacon on it served it with hash browns and a salad with a balsamic vinegarette . 

 the two girl working there were so unprofessional from their interaction to the attire ."
5,"wow . if you 're into owner - driven , husband - and - wife run , casual and unpretentious yet upper - class / comfortable "" fine "" environs , food , service , wine , and music ( acoustic live music 3x / wk ( with no cover ! ) ) , the kind of place where everyone talks to / welcomes everyone yet no one is nosy or cliquish , where the whole place cheerfully claps when mrs owner breaks a glass ( and someone calls out "" it 's earlier than that normally happens , "" ) ,   free wi - fi , where you have a nice patio with heaters and a front - row fountain view , wine by the bottle from their extensive retail collection or yours -- with just a $ 5 corkage ( as well as a decent ( 7 - 9 reds and 7 - 9 whites selection by the glass for $ 7-$10 ) , a great craft beer selection ( union jack ipa ! ) , couches , nice hightops , an l - shaped bar , great local artwork ( also for sale ) , this will be your new favorite place . 

 if you like stuffy , over - priced , boring , see - to - be - seen places with angry ( or no ) music , this place is n't for you . 

 second time here and mr owner greets me by name .   are you kidding ? ! does that happen anymore ? and when i say to him "" that 's cool , "" someone else in the bar comments about how i must be new because that 's just how they do it here . 

 you can order anything off the menu from next door ( euro pizza cafe ) for no up - charge . amazing . get the "" dr oz sautéed veggies . "" . trust me . 

 this place has a great vibe and one part of me hopes these positive reviews do n't result in oppressive crowds , but on the other hand , something tells me they 'd handle it with a smile and 5 star service . 

 get here . just get here ."
5,"we recently moved nearby pho ao sen and dine there often . i love their food , the service , and also the atmosphere . my favorite 's are the bun dishes , i always order the no . 26 with chicken instead of pork and they have a delicious vegetarian lemongrass beef vermicelli that i would highly recommend . pho ao sen is a great place to dine with friends , mine have always enjoyed the experience ."
2,"i stayed at san carlos may 19th - 20th . it was merely "" okay "" . 

 i liked : 
 historic old school hollywood feel . it was chic . i dug it . 
 the place had character and i particularly liked the outside of the rooms more than the in . we were in walking distance to the places we wanted to go . 

 how about no on these items : 
 surprise ! no hotel parking . you can pay the valet 20 bucks or pay 15 over at chase 's parking lot . 
 surprise ! they hold an extra $ 25 on your card in case of room damage . 
 ghost lounge ? it was saturday night and the dance floor was empty . it was n't the plan to go there but it was kind of depressing to see that .... 
 ghosty goodness ? nope . there was a somewhat weird vibe about the place but nothing really standing out . my house has had more ghosty vibes and action that i received here . 

 it has the potential to be pretty awesome but the surprise extra money you end up spending seems like it makes up the difference of what you save . 
 i will probably avoid going here again , including the club ."
3,"not terrible .   i got the drunken noodles and pad thai .   not the best , but not the worst .   maybe i 'll try them again and update my review ..."
4,i had dinner at frank & albert 's while attending a conference at the hotel . normal i try not to eat at hotel restaurants due to overcharging and quality of the food . i decided to try frank & albert 's based on the reviews from tripadvisor . tripadvisor rates this restaurant as number two in phoenix . we where seated on the patio next to the open fire pits . how romantic except i was with my work colleagues . frank & albert 's is perfect for a date or anniversary . the location is nested in the luxury hotel setting directly below some kind of canyon . i ordered the fillet mignon . yummy ! ! everything on the menu looked so good . frank & albert 's also had a great wine list . my work colleagues were very happy with my dinner choice . i used opentable to make the table reservation . i would definitely come back frank & albert 's if i was in the area .
5,"this place is a lil bit of awesomeness ! the food was great , the service was awesome , and the atmosphere was very nice ! what 's not to like about a great steakhouse that serves great food and provides awesome service ."
3,"this really is more of a lady 's hardware store with more design / decorating stuff , small appliances , and such . but this time they had something hd did n't , and at a good price .   almost exactly what i was looking for , too . 

 even if you 're a die - hard hd shopper , it does n't hurt to check here too ."
4,"you know how you poke fun at people who go to a steakhouse and they order something like chicken or seafood ? i 'm one of those people , but this time i teamed my seafood with steak ! 

 they had a prix fixe menu that carried over from their new year 's eve dinner , but i skipped over that ... 

 i have to say , i loved my sirloin and 5 pieces of shrimp . shrimp was done correctly - not rubbery or charred and * gasp * it was actually de - veined . i ca n't tell you how i 've gone to nicer restaurants and their shrimp was n't de - veined . so that alone got a little happy dance from me . 

 food was a bit on the salty side , but it did n't make me have a massive thirst craving when we left the restaurant . server was friendly and knowledgeable , which was great ! 

 hubby ordered his prime rib , but they did n't have it blue which was the way he wanted it . it 's all good , they still brought him out some of the rarest prime rib i 've seen in a long time ... 

 for an appetizer we ordered bacon wrapped scallops . i am a firm believer of ' bacon makes everything good ! ' and it did . the sauce that came with the dish was delicate and flavorful . the fresh rolls that came minutes before the entree was served were my favorite kind - light and fluffy on the inside while the outer layer had enough crunch that satisfied me , yet did n't make me feel like i was about to chip any teeth . ;) 

 i ca n't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes !"
3,"love dicks , richardsons etc etc but come on i 'm throwing down 120 $ get some   servers / managers with customer service skills ."
5,"love the four peaks . can get crowded as hell , and parking is a bit of a cluster f , but i 've never ever not had a fun night there .   the beer is excellent , the service has always been attentive , and the food is above normal bar standards 

 the fish and battered fries was very good , the tartar sauce is good , but ask for the cocktail sauce . . . it 's fantastic .   heavy on the horseradish enough to feel it in your nose !   and the rueben might just be the best in town . 

 the happy hour is great .   $ 3 locally brewed pints ?   sign me up 

 the location and the it being an actual brewery gives it extra points .   i had family in town this week , and i like to take out of towners to places that have a local az vibe .   they definitely got a taste of my arizona .   next time they 'll have to come during pumpkin porter season"
3,"priced decent , quantity heavy . just ordered a side of chips and got almost a pound of chips . i love chips and salsa , but this was too much than i thought . anyway the food was good and seems to have a authentic mexican flavor to it . worth a short once , particularly if you are pretty hungry ."
5,"this review is for the food only .   if you care about parking and what kind of extras they sell that are n't food related you 'll have to check out another review . 

 i love lgo .   the food is absolutely top notch and i love how the menu has both traditional fare and a few things you 've never heard of like their venice beach burrito which is filled with scrambled eggs , tofu chorizo , spinach , and other goodies .   it comes with a side of salsa which also fantastic .   i eat breakfast here all the time and i have never been disappointed .   also , if you 're in a hurry grab one of their pre - made granola / yogurt / fruit parfaits , yum !"
1,"this wendy 's is terrible . i grew up going to wendy 's but recently the whole chain has become disgusting . this one is just a slow , disgusting chain . blah , rather eat pretty much any where else ."
4,"clean , comfortable , smoke - free , fast service , nice staff . 

 also , their complimentary breakfast had a nice variety of food items . there is juice and coffee ; bagels , yogurts , waffles and cereals . 

 the hotel was a lot nicer than i expected , and i would definitely stay here again ."
1,they would n't honor pet co 's online sale prices .   that 's the first time i 've heard about this .
3,"meh , i 'm not completely sold . 

 it 's so much smaller than a traditional b&n and they did not have anything i was looking for . nevermind any of the school related supplies i would have like to seen . 

 i do n't think i 'll come back here , i 'll make my way to borders ( yada yada as you will ) . i wo n't be going to the next nearest b&n ( tempe ) because i do n't have a car and the energy just is n't worth it ."
2,"went around lunch today and got a blended double chocolate mocha . the staff were really nice and the building is really cool , but my coffee was more of a milk shake than any sort of blended coffee - i even asked to make sure it was made with coffee . it had no coffee flavour at all and certainly was n't "" double chocolate "" . i loved all their different seating , the vintage cash register and even one of the coolest bathrooms i 've ever been in , but if i 'm going to pay nearly $ 5 for a 16 oz drink , i want it to taste amazing . was also disappointed that they did n't have any real selection in the bakery case - it was all sandwiches , breads , and a tarte ( which looked good but was also overpriced ) . they apparently won some prizes for "" best cupcake "" or something and there were no cupcakes in the case when i went in ."
4,great prices and fresh food ...
5,carlsbad tavern is my favorite mexican restaurant . i love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and i love that they have hoegaarden on tap .. i 've had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing . they serve new mexico cuisine here . the only difference i noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans . i have a lot of friends from new mexico and they all love this restaurant . the food here is delicious and flavorful if you do n't live in the neighborhood it 's definitely worth the drive .
5,"my wife and i just dined at this restaurant . i am a chef and must say that chef chris 's concept is one i have not experienced . the food was outstanding , service excellent and the decore was creative , down to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on .   our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice .   what really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course . being a chef i had to share a neat appetizer , that i recently found , using a baby corn shoot !   chef keep up the suberb cafe monarch bravo ."
2,"save your money and go to kyoto bowl . our waiter gaves us our metal bowls and then coddled my family like we 're children . they have all the waiters follow us to get in line for the self - service buffet . they stand there like if you get out of line , you 're bad . weird ... during this time , the waiter goes on and on about their food and what they have . then when you get to the buffet , the choices are very limited and the food is so full of fluff you do n't get to put much food in . some of it is meant to be like sushi , uncooked , but since you put it in a bowl , it gets cooked with everything else . oh yeah , and the place is loud . you 'll have to sit elbow to elbow to hear your family . the novelty about this place is that you can watch the cooks cook your dismal amount on an open fire oven . that 's the coolest thing about this place . they serve it in these trendy lopsided bowls . at this point , the food has really shrunk . the food is tasteless . anyways , they give you the bill and even though somebody else paid for my bill , i was shocked by the price ~ $ 10 a bowl . if i had $ 10 , i 'd rather go to taco bell ."
4,"being too "" frugal "" to rip out a perfectly good , if not ugly , bathroom vanity top , i decided to look for ways to improve upon the "" cultured marble "" 80 's look that was going on .   after talking with my co - worker and fellow - yelp - er , robert , i decided to go the "" refinish "" route instead of "" rip it out "" and put in new .  

 after checking the internet i came across a company called "" miracle method . ""   if you get a chance and you 're thinking of having your bathtub , tile , vanity or kitchen countertop replaced , check out this company first ! 

 i did get an estimate on ripping out the tile around my tub and having a new floor installed , but that would have still left me with a no so great looking tub and an ugly vanity .   oh , and the estimate i received from the "" other "" place did n't provide tile so after all was said and done , i would n't be saving anything .   so i bit the bullet and decided to spend the $ 1,600 . 

 so the job was started promptly at 8:30a.m . on tuesday by "" shawn . ""   a very nice young man who obviously likes what he 's doing .   ( sometimes hard to find in folks these days ! )   tuesday involved cleaning , prepping and spraying the tub .   wednesday the tub was finished off then the tile and vanity were prepped and sprayed .   time on thursday was spent applying several layers of sealant to the tile area and vanity top .   friday was a quick visit .   shawn cleaned everything up and returned it to a much better than original version of a master bath .  

 i 'm very happy about the final results and i 'm seriously considering having my main bathroom redone as well .   again , if you 're thinking about making changes to your bath or kitchen , check out miracle method as a possible solution to your problem !   i 'm a fan !"
3,"the very definition of an average brunch .   my omelet was pretty decent , and it 's nice that they let you choose a bunch of ingredients if you want to .   however the breakfast potatoes are extremely weak , fairly bland and underseasoned and are probably not hand cut and prepared .   they are mixed with an uninspiring blend of green peppers .    the rest of my table seemed to feel about as enthusiastic as i did about their breakfast burritos . 

 the service was also pretty slow .   despite the awesome patio and pretty good eye candy among the patronage here , this place is definitely one you can skip ."
1,"i give this location no love .   we went to this one rather than the one uptown on a saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience .   going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant , we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat , then shoved and i mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when i kindly asked to move a single table down ( really sick of bitchy hostesses in scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake )   our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us , sushi took forever , and if you can believe it the fun had nt even begun yet .  
 when paying the bill , we present the voucher to the waitress , who says she ca nt take it .   the manager came over with a bitchy look , basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly not appreciated .   she takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it ( taking another 10 minutes ) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri .   this created one pissed off yelper instantaneously . 

 do n't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still would nt give a damn .  

 and for the sake of all that is holy - stop with the crazy i'm - too - sexy - for - myself scene !   you're not that cool !"
4,"very good food . the tepanyaki was great ! 

 it does have a certain atmosphere though . remember to dress appropriately . it can also be a bit pricey ."
4,"i went to tuck last night because of the reviews on here , and i loved it .   it really is tucked away and all the better .   it feels even more special .   we had the panini bites , dates stuffed with chorizo , and the citrus brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles .   not your greasy comfort food here .   everything was delicious and i ca n't wait to go back and try more ."
1,"what are you all talking about ? ! this place is awful . there s a reason why these sandwiches are $ 3 . i ca n't believe so many people like this place , ( although the place was filled with the chinese people and they have been known to have different taste buds ) you get a 10 inch piece of bread with a bunch of stringy cheap vegetables . from what they said , there was meat on there too ,   however i forgot to bring my microscope to verify if there was any on there . this place is like a middle school cafeteria smack dab in the heart of tokyo 's slums ( i do n't know any vietnamese cities ) . please , homeless people , save your quarters , you 're too good for this place . they have good milkshakes , but if you really are homeless ( as you should be if you 're going to lee 's ) you should n't be buying "" rich people "" milk shakes anyways , stick with the dollar menu ."
5,good jib . fast an friendly .
4,"this is a bit far from us , but we went and we had a great time . i loved browsing the local goods , and the fact that it 's pet friendly was a huge plus in our book . the old lady who our dog sniffed , on the other hand , should probably take a chill pill . i also got a great bunch of fresh basil from this place , which had excellent aroma and taste ."
5,"i 've been in a handful of times , and last night was also no disappointment . after looking for a place to have a glass of wine late , i ended up here , as 3 or 4 other places in old town were either closed ( napoleon 's and tapas papas fritas both closed at 11 pm ? ? ? well , napoleon 's closed forever , so i heard , but wo n't believe ... ) or dead . citizen had a multi - course private affair they were finishing up . kazimierz had some kind of themed jazz party going and was raucous and demanded a cover charge . but good ol' cosmopolitan - cool az88 was next on my list , where i had a fantastic pinot noir ( and tempranillo ) , cheese plate ( their kitchen stays open till 12:30 every night ) , and warm and friendly convo with spot - on bartender steen . another bartender came in later and was relating his favorite summer drinks in a bon vivant fashion . they do have a killer moscow mule which is served in a copper tankard to keep it cool . 

 i 've been coming in here , on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007 , and let me say at az88 the good things do n't change . they still have a tantalizing food menu ( they are a full boar upscale restaurant ) , and a drink menu that , together , rival anything else , really , in lower scottsdale ( and in much of the valley ) . not to mention the atmosphere that for me has the perfect combination of sophistication , decor , music ( 4 more stars for the dj 's mellow - ambient rhythms ) service , and vibe that indulges all the senses wonderfully . i 'm now making this place my default destination for treating myself or a date like vips , as they 've shown what it takes to to be among the best at what they do ."
3,"good salad options . it is definitely tough to mess up lettuce and veggies .   as for the rest of the selection , we must have just come on a bad night . the pasta was overcooked and mushy , not even close to al dente .   fresh fruit selection consisted of only 3 fruits , not exactly a vast selection .   if you want a good salad , definitely the place to go ."
4,"i went to khai hoan yesterday and ordered the rare beef pho .   now , this is the first time i have had pho before and i would say it is much like a glorified bowl of ramen noodles .   that said , it was good .   to me , not great , just good .   we got the combination appetizer plate .   the spring roll was amazing .   the crab was great .   i did n't like the "" egg roll "" as much as i thought i would , but it was definitely fresh .   i had fresh coconut juice to drink and it was delightful .   i would go back again for sure , but i would be ordering something other than the pho ."
2,"over the last 5 years or so , i 've eaten lunch at dilly 's deli a couple dozen times . the location is excellent , as it is near my office , and the interior décor is clean , modest , and charming . the music seems to vary , but on today 's trip , it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening . while i 've never had to wait for a table to clear , seating can be limited during lunch hours . the service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting . vegetarians will find a handful of options here , though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad . 

 carrying boar 's head ingredients is a plus , however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply does n't work for me . oftentimes , i find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less ( and sometimes none at all ) toward the outer parts nearing the crust . it has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way , though the only wrap i 've tried ( mexi ) lacked flavor and tasted processed . 

 i 've eaten one salad at dilly 's - the greek - and , while it is tasty , i discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and have n't ordered a salad there since . 

 as other reviewers have reported , the soups are n't as piping hot as i 'd like , though the variety and additional "" daily soup "" is appreciated . 

 the bread is deliciously soft , warm , flavorful , and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad . if you 're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal - sized slices , i suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup , salad , or dessert as well . all sandwiches are served with a pickle spear . 

 the cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own . 

 today i gave dilly 's another shot and ordered a new menu item , the red bird , on wheat . personally , i 'm not a fan . the blazin ' buffalo , dilly bird , and smokey mountain boast far better flavor combinations , imo . also , my pickle spear had a hair on it . 

 dilly 's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition ( all whole sandwiches are $ 6.99 ) , though a reasonable price if shared . 

 overall , this is a higher quality sandwich shop than subway , blimpie , and the like . unfortunately , the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread / meat ratio issue guarantee i will not return ."
4,"coming from a place where there is mexican food on every couple streets , i have truly missed an authentic mexican restaurant or joint . this place is legit ! good tacos , good burritos , real good non - taco bell mexican !

3,"typical dumpy yet fairly clean little sports bar in a strip mall setting . get your tires changed next door at discount tire and grab a few heinekins while you wait . beware though , they call it coppers because it is owned and frequented by cops and for some reason there are a lot of people missing limbs that frequent the place . ? . hum . ho ."
4,"sadly , another victim of tempe marketplace killing mill ave --this z gallerie location is closing and they 're liquidating the inventory . if you 've had your eye on something for a while , get your tuchus in there stat !   the entire store is 30 % and sale items get an additional 10 % as of this week . i got a $ 149 candelabra i 'd been eyeballing for months -- for $ 40 ! !   it was already on sale at 70 % off and they threw in an additional 10 % off the sale price . can not beat that with a bat !"
5,"three cheers to yelp for helping me find where in the valley to go for real beef jerky !   the fresh stuff which has more beef than chemicals .   ( the convenience store packages just were not doing it for me ! ) after checking out the website , i emailed good friends in las vegas ( who used to live in minnesota ) , asking if they were familiar with von hanson 's .   ( they have 21 locations in minnesota - and one in chandler . ) 

 my roommate and i went on july 2 . they were running a special for ny strips - buy one , get one free - so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerky . score !   we picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy .   $ 18/lb .   the ny strips were ( if memory serves ... ) $ 14.99/lb , and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/4 lb - so super yay for the bogo sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices . i have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing !   just looking at the cuts in the display case , i can declare von hanson 's makes aj 's look like fry 's !   these were gorgeous !   quite possibly the prettiest steaks i 've ever seen!i also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog , and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage ( linguisa ) . 

 admittedly , i am not a sausage expert .   plus , i live very close to schreiner 's - so while i would have no problem buying sausage from von hanson 's , i would n't make the hike to chandler just for those .   the selection was quite impressive , though ! 

 overall - this place has everything for carnivorial happiness !   ( hey - if you understood the context , it 's a word , right ? )   great selection of beef , chicken and pork products .   tons of spices , sauces , rubs and marinades .   nice selection of unique beer and wines .   fridge and freezer cases with more meats , sides , and desserts ! yes , it 's pricey - but the quality is certainly there to justify it . 

 once home , we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub .   omg amazing meat !   probably the best steak i 've had in years - and ny strip is n't even my cut of choice ! 

 the peppered beef jerky is full of yum - and this is so strange to write - but the cajun is a bit spicy for my taste .   ( and i adore spicy ! )   it 's amazingly good , and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat . 

 the vegas via minnesota friends emailed back monday - they know von hanson 's quite well - and are grateful there is n't one in vegas - it would kill the weekly grocery budget with how often they 'd be in !   they love , love , love the place - and i am now under strict orders to bring them care packages from here whenever i come up to visit ! 

 oh - and layla ( my pooch ) was pretty stoked about the pig ears - so in addition to my five stars , please add two paws up !   ( i did n't tell her they have a whole dog food and treat section - i am on a budget , after all ! )"

 service also great !

5,"let me preface this story with the fact that it was not my little guy who i had to take in . i am dog sitting my friend 's dog . they are on vacation . dr. alber and his amazing staff were unbelievable . i called at 5:15 . they got me in at 5:30 . dr. alber spent 40 minutes with me . explained everything to me thoroughly . little rusty just has allergies and an eye infection but it was making him miserable . dr. alber gave me a plan of attack to care for it . extremely cost effective . $ 70 out the door , rx in hand and a tube of eye drops . i am in awe . i will recommend this clinic to everyone i know . i just can not say enough good things about these lovely people . thank you prestige animal clinic . you rock ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i will now be taking my own little guy there . you guys are now the only vet i will ever use ."
4,"i 've only hiked camelback once , but i felt so accomplished ( albeit winded , and mere minutes away from passing out ) . 

 we started the hike at 6 in the morning , and got to watch the sunrise while we made our way up the trail .   i thought it was n't going to be a bad hike , but things get tougher about two - thirds up .   things starting getting vertical at some points , and i was n't really prepared for that . 

 it was totally worth it once we got to the top , though - gorgeous , 360 view of the phoenix metro area ( and really , much more than that ) .   and watching the sunrise with someone special is pretty awesome too ."

1,"wish i could rate negative stars .... with so many bar choices this place is by far the worst . 

 last saturday a group of friends went out for a friend 's birthday celebration in scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at loco patron . it was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early . we finished our last call drinks and started to head out . the friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom . at this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave . my friend started to explain his reason for not leaving ( friends still in bathroom ) but was quickly cut off . i watched from the patio as the two bouncers ( both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend ) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out . as he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him . the bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment , pinned him down with their elbows and hit him . at this point i had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him . i had already taken out my phone to call 911 and i quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force . we demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request . he swiped my friend 's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground . several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive . the police arrived and took down the bouncers ' information and stated that they would be recording this incident . 

  i am absolutely adamant in saying that neither i nor my friends will ever frequent loco patron again . we were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening , non physical patrons of their establishment . based on the behavior of the two bouncers i assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves . what i witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and i plan on writing any regulatory agency i can think of . these people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law ."

5,"we ate here to celebrate our engagement during a weekend getaway to az . my fiance had coordinated with the restaurant beforehand to have rose petals and 2 glasses of champagne set for us before we arrived . the rose petals were fresh and a mix of red , yellow , and pink ... beautiful colors ! 

 i ordered one of their fish dishes that came is a really hot skillet , and i accidently burned my hand on the skillet . we saw one of the employees walking by , so we asked if he had anything for the burn , and he ran off looking for burn spray and bandaids . he was back in no time with everything i needed to treat the burn - amazing service ! i think his name was nick , but i ca n't remember . 

 good job , t cooks !"
4,"upon suggestion of the "" scottsdale native , "" i landed here one night for dinner . this place is part of fox restaurant concepts group who is also responsible for culinary dropout , wildflower , modern steak , zin burger , sauce , montana avenue , bloom among others . 
 atmosphere : awesome . very happening , trendy with mostly young professional and older folks . huge place with big open space . great for groups with long table seating either booth or traditional table or couch . the wall opens up to the outdoor patio where you can sit on couches .   we sat inside since it was a bit chilly . 
 food : latin / mexican inspired menu . huge portions ! 
 1 . complimentary chips / salsa - did n't have any chips as i like to usually eat my salsa by spoon since it 's lower calorie that way . good flavor , nothing spectacular . wish it were a bit more chunkier . 
 2 . fish tacos - the native and i split this dish and it was brought out split for us . it was like 2 entrees ! i 'm glad we split this since it was a ton of food . the dish came with rice , pinto beans ( choice of black beans as well ) . mini fish tacos ( 4 ) with grilled fish , avocado , pico de gallo . very yummy . always a fan of the grilled food even though it increases your colon cancer risk . 
 3 . crab and shrimp ceviche - containing cucumber , avocado , radish . nice flavors . not memorable however so there not much to write here ..... simply because i ca n't remember ..... i know it was n't bad though . 
 service : no complaints here . attentive enough . 
 parking : private lot . no problems finding a spot . 
 conclusion : i think i would come here again more for the atmosphere but food is good too !"
1,"this place used to be amazing .   my favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents .   it 's not the same anymore . 

 we went for my wife 's 30th birthday .   my dad decided to join us .   my wife ordered steak and shrimp , my dad ordered steak , i ordered a crab stuffed lobster .   i have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before .   i was craving it . 

 we got our appetizer 's .   dad got snails , wife and i shared steamers .   my dad was happy with the snails .   but then again , how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter ?   the steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth .   it was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers .   i was n't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams . 

 the food came and for the first time in my life i was asking the server to take back my meal before i even tried it .   it looked dry and over cooked .   i told the server i 've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it 's supposed to be .   he told me this is what it 's supposed to look like and begged me to try it .   i took one bite and i could n't even swallow it because it was so dry .   of course the server was gone by this point and did n't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was . 

 while i was waiting for the server to return , i told my family i was just going to get the steak .   they just shook their head and told me not to .   i took one bite of my dad 's steak and spat it out .   how do you screw up steak this bad ?   it tasted like beef jerky and butter .   my dad and wife would have complained too , but it 's my wife 's birthday and i am already stealing her thunder .   i swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster .   how do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster ?   fortunately , that came out fine . 

 so we left hungry and $ 300 poorer .   i used to not mind paying the money they charged but now , it is not worth it .   i am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down ."
5,"what can i say - we 're cf regulars ... just love the place . i guess we are lucky because we have never had to wait more than 15 - 20 minutes for 3 of us .   we eat here at least twice a month and we always start with the avocado egg rolls - they are to die for and the dipping sauce is yummy !   i usually get a glam burger - the only time i eat red meat -   and so far have not had one i did not like . i   often take 1/2 home so i can save room for some cheesecake , an absolute must when at cf . we have never had a bad cheesecake and try a different one each time . this is the only hamburger that i have liked the next day - usually hamburger is the one food that is not a good take home food as it just does not taste good as a left over - but i have actually eaten it cold because i took a bite before heating it and just kept going ... yes , weird i know . 

 if nothing else , go there for some avocado egg rolls and then treat yourself to a cheesecake .... i'm totally addicted ! absolute divine decadence ! ;d"

5,"prepare to spend a few hours here and really have a romantic experience . the food is divine . the service is laid back ( in a good way ) . the chef runs the whole show and plays all hats . the menu is forever changing and when you make a reservation he will ask you questions so he can tailor your meal and experience to your needs . probably not a good first date place because if the date goes wrong , you will be stuck for a while . perfect spot for an anniversary or something . or even just to have a nice meal with people you know and care about ."
3,"bar smith has potential to be a chic hot spot in the heart of downtown ; just a few steps away from the symphony hall , chase field , and the us airways arena . however , this place , despite it 's pseudo - hipness fails to deliver in the cocktail department , which , with it 's continuously crappy music , would be the only real reason you 'd come to this bar . it 's really a 2.5 star place-- bartenders are nice , but do n't really get the job done . when you 're paying over $ 8/drink , you 'd at least expect them to do that . the roof is cool though so an extra .5 stars for that ."

 i understand that turbulence is normal . but i would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly , then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives . 
 oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive , its probably best that you do n't have to overhear the pilots saying "" wow , that was scary . i 'm surprised we landed alright . "" 
 morons . they should pay for the trauma i 'll have for the rest of my life ."
5,if you have never been before you should really try harder ... your mother taught you better than that . go and buy a smoked pecan paleta .
4,the food was n't phenomenal but it was very good . the service was excellent . the decor was very cool . a good experience . great selection of wines by the glass . very pleasant experience .
4,"so i came here in search for phoenix 's best macaroni and cheese . yep , that 's right , me and the inner kid in me are in search of the best macaroni and cheese . 

 so , ordering was simple ! 

 so , how was it ? pretty good ! it was more cheddary than , say , beckett 's table ( which got me started on this dance ) . 

 the atmosphere was pretty cool there . however our wonderfully bubbly waitress probably came over way too much . also , nobody coming over to refill our drinks ( iced tea ) could figure out that we had tea and not water . oh well . 

 on a separate note , i 've gone by this place around 2am it looks like a madhouse . could be a rather interesting time around 2am !"
5,"roka akor has a classy atmosphere , and a slightly formidable menu to pick from . everything looks so good , and in a new environment , i want to try it all ! but my date and i , after much deliberation , decided to "" go for broke "" , as it were and if we could n't finish , at least we had a good sample of the menu . 

  for an appetizer , we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad . these were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly . the butterfish was delicate , and the salad was great - the greens had all sorts of different flavors , and not that "" generic clump of lettuce "" flavor i hate . 

  from the sushi menu , i was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before , so i ordered the wagyu gunkan . my date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and oh - so - chivalrously gave me his piece . it 's true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served . the wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree - which i was n't expecting , and i thought the onion was a bit much . 

  at for the skewers we ordered , my date liked his sweet potatoes the best , but i was partial to the crispy bbq . these turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice , run through with a skewer . pure white sushi rice in the center , the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet bbq sauce that comes on eel sushi , which gave the whole thing a nice , crispy shell . 

  at this point , i got to what i consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal : the yuzu marinated black cod . the cod , cooked on the robata grill in a leaf , was meltingly soft and delicately flavored . it was an effort to be share fairly . i believe my date said after our first taste of it , "" just eat what you want and i 'll finish ... "" ,   i looked up from my chopsticks , "" ... you know what ? just cut me off half . "" 

  i was n't sure that i could handle dessert after eating so much , but we finally decided it would n't be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over , right ? so we ordered the baked green tea custard , and it was a perfect pick after a gut - busting meal . light and airy , it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as i was eating it . 

  our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh , at least to my taste buds . in order starting with least harsh : pineapple , honeycomb , raspberry , and apple . i did n't like the last two , but the pineapple was , in my mind , a fairly dangerous thing to drink when you 're not paying attention . smooth . 

  that 's it for the food , and as for the service , it was swift and considerate ; glasses were kept full , and empty plates whisked away . there was , however , one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness . the waiter , who had up till this point been very nice and chatty , helpful about menu items , and generally a pretty cool guy , handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying . 

  what am i supposed to do with this ? are we going to call our waiter up and say ... well , what ? it flummoxed me ."
5,"i love this place . my gf and i go every time we visit her parents in north scottsdale . 

 pro 's 
 quick and easy . good service . clean . good food . good management . not too expensive . they also post nutrition info on their menu ( that alone is laudable ) . 

 cons , 

 the salad dressing is quite sharp ."
2,"i got 3 strikes at verde , hence ... i'm out ! strike 1 : not very vegetarian friendly . strike 2 : they have all the necessary items to make nachos , but when asked if they would make me nachos i got a very quick and blunt "" no "" . strike 3 : when forced to order a meat dish and request they not include the meat ( the most expensive ingredient ) not only did they make no attempt to substitute the meat with maybe beans , or guac , or extra cheese , they still charged full price ! i do n't want to eat meat and i sure do n't want to pay for it . 

 and as far as the food , well , they got that part right , for a place that serves fine fast food , when you ask me how my meal was , my response would be "" fine "" ."
4,"this restaurant is close to my office , so we go for lunch at least once a month .   i love that it 's bright , with great modern decor , and the seating is comfortable .   service is always very good .   the prices and portions are a average for the area .   the cuisine is a twist on sonoron , but nothing extraordinary ."
4,"sadly , this souper salad has closed .      :-("
4,i love this place . a little on the pricey side but the food is awesome and the staff is always cool .
5,"attention all parents , nannies , guardians etc .   koko bees is tons of fun !   the kids are all smiles & full of laughter .   terrific environment :   oodles of play houses ,   dress ups , costumes , toys , themes & settings !   the little ones imaginations can run wild .   they even offer fantastic dance , sports , yoga and tumbling classes for the children !   this is a great place to come with the kiddos ! !"
4,"had myself a new york striploin and it was quite good although i do hate paying these kind of prices for steak .   i really thought the vegetables were more special than the steak , but if you compare what kind of quality steak you get here compared to say donovan 's ( high quality steakhouse in ca ) , i 've got to say that i like the overall package presented at keg steakhouse with respect to the quality and price ."
3,"well , it dropped a star for me , and i 'll tell you why . eaten there probably 20 time in the last quarter . i 've had it all ; all you can eat sushi , bowls , desert , beer . ate alone , ate with sandra k , ate with son and family ( including 3 year old grandson who plays drums with the chopsticks ) had a party of 12 there . 

 service .... slow on saturday for the ayes , otherwise i ca n't complain . there are some "" bright "" spots . first , it 's close to my neighborhood , a start and there is more than sushi and that is helpful when you have non - sushi lovers with you . the bowls are very good and you can order them in the heat index you like . funny names to them as well , like the "" exit wound bowl "" or "" the classified bowl with this description;don't order this bowl "" . 

 squid salad is great , great , great ! calamari , ok . hey they put a lot of thought into their beer selection and that is cool . and their dessert sushis are very unique . 

 as for the sushi .... i now have way too many sushi restaurants to try and they are all falling over themselves for your business . sushi has become really "" hip "" lately but there will be a fall out in this category as the economy continues to slow and people , let 's face it , are pulling back . this is not a place for a sushi purist , but give me good food , a cool gathering place ( close to my central phoenix abode ) and i will be there . sushi has got to get better for me to rate higher and "" earn "" my business ."
3,"my boyfriend , myself , and his 3 year old foster sister met up with his mom , dad , and 2 year old foster sister . we were all heading up to prescott this past saturday ( 1/30 ) to play in the snow . when we got there , they were already set up with drinks & pancake balls ( strange , yet greasy & delicious ) . they 'd placed our orders as well since they texted us for them when we were still 15min or so behind them . the food was good . the service was just okay this time since i ca n't remember if anyone ever came to give refills on anyone 's drinks . i know they came by and asked if everything was okay a few times , but that was it . still , friendly staff . the bathrooms were n't anything spectacular , but it 's a bathroom ... at a denny 's . 

 anyways , we all left full and went on about our day ."
4,"i feel like an east coast gangster when i roll up to lgo for breakfast . i 'll take the jersey girl ... pump fist and hair toss ! ! hands down , it 's the best omelette i 've ever had . and the fresh - squeezed oj hits the spot . 

 after a hike at camelback , it 's relaxing to come and sit on the patio ... if you can find a spot . weekends this place is a zoo ! ! during the week is pretty crazy but has its peaks . 

 the french toast is pretty tasty and they do pastries just right . muffins are baked fresh , toast is always spot on perfect . i want their toaster ! 

 i 've had the pizza , which is pretty decent but not the best i 've eaten . the salads are delish ."
1,"the location has closed ( again ) .   not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed .   some speculation on other sites is that they have filed for bankruptcy again . 

 do n't bother stopping by to use their services as the facility is cordoned off and a big sign says "" business closed "" ."
5,best pasta i have ever had . do n't go there if you 're looking for a two - pound chicken parm or endless breadticks .
3,"typical chain "" southwestern / tex mex "" food in a corporatey atmosphere . they have some tasty dishes and a killer sunday brunch , but everything on the menu is kind of ambiguous . 

 prices here are about on par with most places of this type ( i put it in the applebee 's , tgi friday 's , charleston 's , etc . ) category . 

 i enjoyed my visit to this location better than my visits to the pv and tempe locations ."
4,"pros 

 good pizza 
 fancy , expensive but not outrageously expensive 
 clean interior 
 outside setting with heating lamps to add to setting . 
 good drinks ( got a green tea , the name of the tea , called "" infusion "" , lives up to it 's name ! ! ! ) 
 the design of the outside , and inside , makes the place a 5/5 for the interior . the food is great ! me and a friend shared pizza ( toppings were meaty sausage and cheese ) . the bill did n't come out to a large amount . the wait was a tad excessive . there 's a bar . friendly service . 


 cons : 
 none for me , been here only once and will never be here again because we were tourists"
4,"oh lawd ! ! ! 

 so , i 'm a relative nevercomer to this cuisine . like most people , i hear ' szechuan ' and i think ' just spicy panda express food ' . meh . i could n't have been more wrong . 

 i was in atlanta with a friend , and he took me to a place that specialized in szechuan cuisine . i had my first experience with szechuan peppercorns there , and i was hooked . all i can say is , if you have n't already tried authentic szechuan cuisine , then you owe it to yourself to give this place a shot . and if you have , then you already know what i 'm tombout and you probably already eat here all the time any damned ways . 

 enough other reviews have touted the wonders of that amazing spice , the szechuan peppercorn , so i 'll let their words be the guiding lights of wisdom for that . what i 'm gon na tell you is- i travel all over this great nation of ours , and this place delivers the goods , in the way that i want them . the food is inexpensive , it 's reliable tasty , and it 's exactly what it 's supposed to be . other people have complained about the service , and to that , all i can say is :   "" get over it "" . it is what it is , and i have n't had any problems here . their food is exactly what it should be , it tastes exactly like it 's supposed to , and i love it . 

 still keeping an eye out for one of these asian girl + white guy couples , though ..."
2,unfortunately this ups location is less than friendly or helpful .   try the location near fry 's in fountain hills .   they are very friendly and helpful ! !
5,"it is sometimes difficult to start out busy and maintain great standards from the beginning .   the parlor seems to be nailing it .   hip yet comfortable decor .    very creative design , and i loved he subtle yet present homage to the former tenant salon de venus .   as soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm and sincere smile , and that same enthusiasm was felt by every single staff member we encountered .  
 ah the food !   fresh ingredients , a great light pizza crust , and an original beet salad all   had us raving .    the only minor picky foody issue was the nectarine crustada for dessert was luke warm at best , would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream .  

 but why nit pic ?   this place is a big hit , from the moment you walk past the fresh herb and vegetable garden ,   to the fantastic staff and the   savory food , this place is already on my regular rotation ."
4,"sorry jesse had such a bad experience here .   i have been using this place for about , well ,   from the week they opened as it is so close to my office . 

 they have never lost or damaged any of my clothing , and i drop my wife 's delicate stuff off here as well for dry cleaning .   they have also always been true to their word on when i can pick up my clothes - although i am usually days late on the pick - up ( one benefit of being a clothes - horse i guess ) . 

 two doors down from dunkin , so fantastic to drop and pick the rags and then grab a cup o'joe before hitting the office .   the women who work there are n't too hard on the eyes , either , which is always a plus . 

 hard to believe they are still using a dot matrix printer , but that has no impact on service ."
4,"orange table is one of my go - to spots in the valley .   the food and atmosphere are superb .   the wide assortment of beverages certainly strengthens ot 's menu when pairing food and drink . 

 i will admit that while the location may seem hard to find , there are times where i 've had to wait , and wait ... but if you enjoy great food then it is worth the wait . 

 their salads and burgers ( especially the wine burger w/ cheese and red onion ) are fantastic !"
2,"i 'll be honest -- this place is good for americans ... but not good enough for chinese people .   the waiters were sort of rude to us , despite our being able to speak their language . 

 furthermore .. what kind of authentic chinese restaurant serves dinner out of plates ? blasphemy ! our table to had to go out of our way to get bowls ! i 'm surprised they had chopsticks . 

 otherwise , their mock   food was salty and pasty , perfect for americans in search of a good orange chicken replacement .   wait .. salty and pasty ? it 's supposed to be a ( insert meat type ) dish , consisting of subtle flavors and intense chili pepper action . 

 neeext ..."
5,"mid size american airport with very good organization , very straight forward , no hassle . 

 security is a little slow and priority lane is n't really priority , it 's more of "" let 's make fun of first class flyers getting pissed "" lane , so let 's welcome first class flyers with big giggle ! ! 

 many stores and food quality is okay . seating areas are limited , at least for the terminal 3 before security , so be aware . 

 lots of volunteers working here to guide you to the right place , there may be more volunteers than passengers . haha ."
3,"firesky resort is a marvelous place to unwind and enjoy the warm dry evening air and fire - lit torches .   whenever i have the opportunity to stay in the kimpton hotel group 's locations , i always know i 've made the right choice .   the hotel was beautiful , hip and inviting .  

 i gave them three stars because the rooms were a nice , but not fabulous , the amenities of l'occitane products definitely helped .   the restaurant taggio was fine , was n't spectacular and definitely was the part of the hotel which was least memorable .  

 the staff was friendly and helpful .   i 'd stay here again , but with the expectation of enjoying the wonderful pool / cabana area and leaving the resort for dinner .   scottsdale has so much to offer , what was i thinking ...."
4,"i am beginning to be hooked on sushi .   two years ago , i would have told you that sushi was just wrong .... but now i am wrong :) 

 i went to sushi eye on friday with my wonderful and lovely friend . ( you know who you are ) i was excited to go there , especially with the rave reviews .   at first i was a little put off since i thought that our server was a little bit of a moron with a splash of attitude .   i ordered an iced tea and before it took her over ten minutes to come back so i could get some pink packets to sweeten it up .   ( and that tea was dark ! ) 

 after that little slip , everything was perfect ... (though my miso soup did n't have any seaweed in it ... which is odd in my book )   i had the spicy scallop and the philly roll ... both were awesome !   and my friend 's california roll with asparagus was the best .   i will have to order that next time for sure . 

 the sushi chef was very nice and the other server there was more attentive .   i loved the menu and it had a lot to offer .   ( and since i am do n't know a lot of my sushi yet , i liked it that they had descriptions )   the place was clean and i really liked the layout .   i will have to go there again and have some sake as well . :)"
5,"we traveled from anthem to find this little turkish heaven .   the drive was worth it . 
 loved everything about this place from the service to the food ! definitely be back ."
4,"came here one night alone .   the hostess sat me down and kept staring at me as if there was a problem eating alone ! i found that a little rude . 

 my waiter , however , was nice .   i only got the french onion soup and chocolate souffle for dessert since i heard good things about their soup .   it came out in this cute little cauldron , piping hot , cheese all gooey , and several crispy chucks of cheeses were tucked near the edges .   it was good french onion soup , although i have not tasted enough different french onion soup to judge it as one of the best .  

 the chocolate souffle took a while to make but it was quite delicious .   my server brought it out and poured this warm choc sauce infused with some sort of liquor .   the etoh did nt evaporate so there was still a strong taste to me , which i do nt prefer .   the souffle itself was soft and fluffy which was good ."
4,"carly 's is a cute little restaurant with a fun atmosphere .   my friends and i started off with the feta rosa and it was a great start !   amazingly delicious- i even added some to my sandwich because i could n't get enough !   i had the pear sandwich with orzo salad as my side and loved every bite !   yummy pear , pruschetto , and cheese perfection ! 

 carly 's is definitely worth checking out .   it has great food and a great atmosphere to boot !"
1,"as i promised myself , i 'd go back again to try it again . yyyeeaahhhh ... sooooo .... the food is still not good . i got the mongolian beef and it 's like "" wha ? really ? is this irl ? "" 

 i 'm a chinese food kind of a fan , this restaurant , i 'm not a fan of ."
5,"i had lunch there recently and was very impressed with the food ,   friendly service and excellent value .   i had a lunch special -- two cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato fries .   they serve the burgers with several pieces of fresh crisp lettuce , tomato and onion .   we will definitely go there again ."
3,"met a few friends here for happy hour .   they had $ 5 martinis , but that 's not what i ended up getting .   they have a drink special everyday .   that day they had the walter crankite , i think !   it was like an appletini with cranberry juice .   we did n't order anything else .   the service was great .   our servere was very attentive ."
4,"double - double , protein style , with pickles and spread only please . and a medium iced tea . in - n - out gets it . i like my burger the way i like it , and they do n't mind serving it my way . they have never screwed up my order . they have the best iced tea , and fresh lemon wedges that are n't pathetically small . they pay their workers a fair wage , and you can tell - they 're all nice and happy . love me some yummy , cheap eats and service with a smile !"
4,"in the mood for a little snack ? this is the place . do n't remember what i ordered ( my indian friend helped me ) , but it was good ! and also try desserts ! !"
4,"zipps is a rocking place with tv screens in all viewable angles . the atmosphere is great and this place really packs it in on game nights like monday night football . smoking is outside because this place is around the tempe border . the service is great and the food is even better . try the chicken tacos ! 
 good times had by all ! 
 check it out some time !"
4,expensive for having grown their own food . good product and fresh
3,"i really do n't know how to rate lolo 's , because , frankly , this place killed me .   it was only temporary , but i was definitely dead , heart stopped , for a solid five or six seconds .  

 lolo 's is serious eats .   so good , it was just painful .   literally .   i really do n't think i can return anytime soon .   i know it 's for the best . 

 i 'm nowhere near joking ."
4,"love the veggie rolls ! also , the saki bombs are quite bomb =)"
5,we went there right before my grandma 's 100th birthday .   there were about 20 of us .   the place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still did n't have a final count of people .   the place was busy but i know why .   everyone had a different dish and we all loved it .   everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much .   we all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place .   extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had !   the staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat !
4,"this place is growing on me . i was n't a big fan at the beginning thinking they cater to the yuppy crowd that wants to be seen . i still think that 's the case , but i think people truly go for the atmosphere and good food . the vig cobb is really tasty and you just ca n't go wrong with sweet potato fries ... my weakness ! the interior is really cool and creative and the vibe is casual and friendly . lunch hour tends to get a little busy , but they have a decent amount of seating for such a small place ."
5,"when i found out that they do banquets here , i was quick to make a reservation for a wedding rehearsal dinner .   the service was as good as it gets ... period .   the food choices my wife and i had to decide on were plentiful , and the result was beyond fantastic !   from the appetizers , to the main courses and finishing with yummy dessert ... this place rocks ."
5,this place was great ... well as great as a doctors visit can be .   they called us ( my son was the patient )   back within 5 minutes and immediately saw a doctor .   she was kind and took her time - asked a lot of questions and did not hastily diagnose and fully explained to us what was going on with my son 's health .
1,this place is disgusting ! !   the bun was dry and stale .   the veggie burger was yucky ... i do n't think i have ever had one i did n't like before .   the kids meals are miniscule .   the topping bar is so simple and plain .   the dips are not very good ... cheese dip is yuck !   drink choices stink .   cookies taste raw and boring .   almost forgot to add that the two young kids did n't even care for the french fries because they are seasoned .   i thought they were a total waste of calories .   i ca n't believe the prices either ... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for .
5,"authentic mouth watering food . 
 got the steak fajitas dinner .... extremely satisfied ."
5,"one of my favorite places to satisfy my sweet tooth !   i typically will get sorbet , and on this evening i decided to get the raspberry sorbet .   i believe that this gelato spot location has the nicest ambiance of all the locations .   after getting my sorbet , i enjoy sitting out on the patio ."
4,i 've been for lunch half a dozen times and usually sit at the bar .   their beers are great .   i 'm a home brewer and am pretty discerning in my beer tastes .   their hopknot ipa has a huge nose of hops if you are a hop lover -- which i am .   however the 8th street pale is probably my favorite .   it is a great balanced english style pale ale -- without the bitter edge of an american pale ale like sn .   on a hot day their kolsch is super refreshing and reminds me of being in germany .   i 've had mostly burgers and fries there and they are good .   the atmosphere is casual and the staff is friendly and attentive .   if you are a craft beer lover it is a nice laid back destination to enjoy a brew ... or two .   they also pour growlers and sell cans of kolsch and kiltlifter in 12 packs .
4,"stopped in for lunch with an old friend .   we had lots to catch up on , so got a booth inside where it was quieter .   the decor is true to tom 's heritage at this location , modernized with lots of historical pics on the wall .   the governor 's room has an attractive gleaming golden state seal over the doorway .  

 service was excellent .   food was ok .   great bar with tom 's specialties , where i do n't water , so no info on that .   i should have had the 1929 chili , or a burger to really try the food .   i had a cuban sandwich with house salad instead .   the salad greens were fresh , the tiny tom atoes sweet and crunchy .   the sandwich was a phoenix arizona cuban sandwich from tom 's tavern , not like a cuban sandwich made by somebody 's cuban mother or abuelo using all the right cuban ingredients .   kind of like mexican food in yellowknife , yukon territory .   good test . 

 next time i 'm having the burger .   there will be a next time .

5,"i love this place . it is one of my favorite antique shops in the city ! there is a wide selection and variety of booths and items . there is everything here from match boxes , cute purses and hats to retro / vintage furniture , wacky mannequins , old cameras and old toys to reminiscence over . and ! they are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff ."
2,"i 've never been to a restaurant where we ( a party of 6 with a reservation ) sat at a cleared table with no water , no bread , no cutlery , no service for 15 minutes before receiving a menu .... when we finally had someone provide a menu , it then took another 15 minutes to get the wine we ordered . 
 still no bread , still no food . 

 the server dumped the wine bottle on the table ( unopened ) , and went to find glasses . 10 minutes later she then threw the bottle opener at our table so we could open the wine ourselves while she went to find glasses . most ( ! ? ! ) of the wine glasses arrived within the next 10 minutes , and still no bread or food . 
 do i need to go on ? 

 and while the server apologized profusely , she never offered to take anything off the bill or even a dessert on the house for our clearly disgruntled group . 

 food was fine -- the house - made burrata is quite remarkable . but not enough of a reason to return . others we were with have had better experiences , and i would hope for the owner 's sake that our dinner was an aberration ..."
2,"i had been wanting to try sal 's for quite a while but never got around to it .   until today !   i got a side salad and the 14 "" sal 's favorite .   i must say , not impressed at all .   the salad was made of what looked like a bag of pre - shredded lettuce .   and not very fresh either .   the pizza was just ok , i 've had much better .   very sad and disappointed , unfortunately i will not be going back to sal 's ."
5,"holy wow batman ! 

 this place is one - of - a - kind ... it 's awesometown & it 's yummy ! 

 once you step inside you 'll instantly   get the picture .     it 's wow factor is off the meter . 

 smeeks sells a never ending selection of treats of all kinds ... it 's the place for unique , off the wall , goofy gifts .    and candy . 

 i give a big round of applause to local , small business owners who stick their necks out in any economic climate but in today 's woe - filled world of running a business , they become instant super heroes !

1,"wish i could review this place on service but i was n't able to get one .   walked in at 1 pm on a sunday afternoon for a mani pedi , was told by the front nail tech to have a seat .   i get it , i walked in on a sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and i am fine to wait .   my wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me .   then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me .   you know your salon , you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before i wasted an hour my time .   i ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away  

 the place in general was dirty , nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere .   i did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy ."
4,"roka akor scottsdale is an extension of the celebrated roka in london . 
 i attended the opening night and a follow up for lunch the following day . overall , i was impressed with the offerings of fresh sushi , and robata grilled tidbits . the dish that really won me over was crab hot pot and the creamy rice was absolutely zoftik . 
 i drank many fresh sochu   infused cocktails , and crushed three bottles of sake with skilled kikisake - shi , sayaka watanabe . this japanese sake sommelier is london - based and the zuma - roka group sake trainer . they do have a fantastic sake selection . easily the best in scottsdale . she loved my sake brand i created with midorikawa called green river , and my low alcohol brand sake , koide , as well . 
 they also have a great italian sommelier named alessandro marchesan , who is also based out of london . too bad they are only loaner personnel from hq in london . 
 the room is clean and beautiful with post modern asian inspired lines . the staff is eager and young , but quite unskilled in refined service .   i am sure that will be a long cycle for the roka management to fix . i have a dear friend who dined there on her birthday . she told me the service was "" shockingly bad . "" she then reiterated that is was ,   "" so bad that it was entertainingly bad ! "" the food great and hopefully the service will match soon . kanpai , roka .. kudos on your sake program ."
4,"been dining here about a year and still trying diff things from the menu and all have been good . i do n't think the heat is unedible even the hottest plates are just "" good "" hot ."
5,best steak i have ever eaten is at ruth 's chris steakhouse . comes to your table sizzling hot . sides are sold individually but are pretty good . the deserts and appetizers are awesome . being an upscale place be prepared to take a hit in the wallet . if you really want to impress a date this would be a good place to do it .
4,i just love this place and   i always leave feeling refreshed and relaxed .   highly recommend any of their spa treatments .
4,"i think half the fun of a used bookstore is the treasure hunt .   this used bookstore is better organized than some of my old haunts in dallas but i will survive . 

 i think of used bookstores similar to looking through your grandmother 's attic at her book collection - it is n't supposed to be all shiny and new . 

 bookman 's has a decent selection of books , i 've found an entire collection of rishdie one afternoon ! of course it is always going to be a crapshoot but that is just the way it is in used books ."
5,"true mexican street fare - at first a little intimidating for this gringa , but it was awesome .    the owner dan ( who happens to be a culinary institute trained chef ) put together a variety pack for us .   everything is small and cheap , so you can get a whole bunch of different stuff to try .   $ 30 fed 5 people . 

 on the ne corner of 19th ave & glendale , next to 7 - 11 .   give 'em a try - you wo n't be disappointed !"
4,"came in a couple of weeks ago with my cousin and we both really enjoyed what we had ordered . we came in during the "" happy hour "" and got 3 appetizers : baba ganoush , tzatziki and feta & olives .   my fave was the feta and olives . i liked the tzatziki but it was a little too minty for my taste .   if there was a way for the mint to be toned down a lot , it would be much better . the pita bread was very soft , fresh and warm . very complimentary . i 'd love to come back and try the spanakopita , mediterranean garlic shrimp and perhaps see if the tzatziki could be less minty . delish !"
5,"what a restaurant ! absolutely loved my experience at tarbells . i 've been hearing rave reviews for quite sometime and decided to try it out recently . my party and i sat at the bar , which was a great choice because the bar was comfortable , rather large and really social and fun . the bartender ( young woman ) was fabulous , inviting and very nice ! she was very attentive . a guest in my party dines at tarbells often and she had his drink in front of him by the time we walked to the end of the bar ..... now that s some customer service for ya ! 

 food = we started with the calamari . a favorite dish of mine and this one was outstanding . two very different but delicious dipping sauces . a roasted red pepper and a pesto mix . not sure which one i liked more :) i enjoyed the pan - seared jumbo sea scallops . to die for . i am a huge scallop fan and these were done just right . caramelized , giving them the right amount a sweet .... and it was served over very yummy risotto . another dish enjoyed by my party was the fennel sausage pasta dish , the fennel sausage was amazing . 

 overall experience was fantastic , as soon as i get another opportunity i will be dining here again ! :)"
1,"wow . i 'm not even going to wait until i 'm done before leaving a review . i just placed my order , 30 minutes after sitting down . 

 11:35 - sit at a table for 8 an order drinks . so far so good . 

 11:39 - things were going alright when we had a table of 8 , but when a few more people showed up to attempt to give floridino 's some money in return for a quick lunch , all hell broke loose . 

 11:41 - there was a room next to us with a bunch of empty tables . "" you ca n't sit in there . we do n't have a server in there . "" screw it , we picked up our drinks and moved in . if they can serve us at that table , they can serve us one table over in this other room . 

 11:45 - we asked to see the manager . 

 11:50 - "" we can get you drinks in here , but not food . we have to wait for a table to open up out there . then we can serve you . "" 

 11:52 - someone who looks like a manager peeks into the room and leaves . we still have n't spoken to a manager ... 

 11:55 - "" we do n't want to overwhelm the kitchen . "" ( hmm .. if you did n't want to "" overwhelm "" the kitchen , maybe you should have taken my order 20 + minutes ago ... ) 

 12:05 - they 're taking our food orders in the forbidden room . i guess they 're not as allergic to accepting our money as they led us to believe . 

 12:32 - just received my food in the forbidden room . pretty much exactly an hour after i got here . 

 you suck , floridino 's ."
4,"i had nt been there in years , and it was all i remembered .   i went with a coupon that i go purchased on the living social website .   champagne toast , appertizer , salad and all you can eat entree .   they also do a complimentary photo for you .   very quaint and romantic .   but the food was fantastic .   we had the cheese fondue that was just delicous .   the meat course was also wonderful .   but the thing that really made our experience great , was waiter .   he was great , and funny and he was there when you needed him . 

 but i do not suggest turning up there without a reservation .   you can make reservations online , very quick and easy and you get a confirmation ."
1,"went to sol for restaurant week .   was less than impressed with the bitter salad with mia avocados , the carnitas that were very bland and boring , the rice was delicious , however the black beans tasted like aspirin , dessert was a dulche flan that was hard , solid and icky .   service was average , took 2 hours to get thru dinner .   best part was the refreshing wine and beer ! 

 cheers to sol , we wo nt be returning ."
4,"planet sub is definitely a good option for solid , good tasting subs . i 'm next door at gangplank a couple times a week and we usually hit this place up for lunch . it 's much better than the last place that was in this spot , has tons of options ( we decided you could eat lunch there for a month and not have the same sandwich ) , and friendly staff . i 'm definitely glad they put this in . it 's a great option in the downtown chandler area ."
1,"i would not recommend this place to anyone .   i went there looking for a gift .   i received no help .   the girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players .   i guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store . also , they did not have a very good selection of items . i think i will take my business to other stores who care about their customers ."
4,"i went here with my parents on a super crowded friday evening . we had to wait about 40 min , but decided to order a couple of drinks while we waited . once we finally got seated , i decided to order the chicken madeira , which is their most popular dish . it was sooo good ! it was a huge portion , but i somehow managed to finish it . i can see why everyone loves it ! my dad ordered the ahi and had to get them cook it more b / c it was practically raw and cold . it was probably supposed to be like that , but he did n't know what he was getting himself into . they took extra care in getting this done - both our waiter and the manager came over to make sure they were on the same page as my dad before cooking it more thoroughly . they also brought my dad a complimentary house salad while he waited . we decided to end our meals by all splitting a piece of their peanut butter cup cheesecake . omg . so good . most importantly , we found that the service at this location was really good ! our waiter was funny , and rolled with the punches ... nothing seemed to phase him ."
1,"went into the location and waited minutes for someone to appear to ask us for our order and even after we said hello they did n't acknowledge us . had to repeat order several times . it was very frustrating how nothing seemed to be in stock , no philly cheese steak nor soup was available . i heard someone as i was leaving being told some type of bread was n't available ( which is actually understandable , condiments and bread sometimes run out or need to be retrieved / baked ) . 

 felt like we were being rushed and just did n't feel like a clean place . will not go back ."
5,"i found this place based on yelp reviews so i feel obligated to add one more 5 star review to the mix . i needed to get a chain fixed on my bike and was not looking to spend a ton of money or hours trying to fix it myself . so i stopped by and had them take a look at it . 

 they recommended a full tuneup to keep it in tip top shape and spent the time explaining and demonstrating why it is deserving of spending money beyond the chain repair .   i ended up passing but did n't feel like they were trying to take advantage of me . since it was close to closing time i left the bike with them overnight and got a call late in the morning the next day for pickup . it has been as good as new ever since . 

 having my fair share of riding in the valley of the sun i 'm sure i 'll be back soon for some inter - tubes or a spare part for whatever craigslist bike i happen to be riding around at the time . 

 protip : check out the unique bike artwork they have around the place . also they have a small bmx ( ? ) track in their "" backyard "" you can ride around and do jumps on anytime ."
3,"i came out here halloween to party , since everything place on mill had a line we just picked this one place to party for the night . drinks are cheap , i was shocked at how low the bill was at the end of the night after buying rounds of drinks until our party got their buzz on , but maybe its just me used to hollywood prices . t_t out in la you get used to paying for parking , cover and then exorbitant prices for drinks .  

 i love their signature cherry vodka drink , its tasty ! its kinda like a shirley temple ? ! service at the bar was quick for the amount of people there . plenty of room for dancing which is always a plus ."
5,"wedge salad is delish ! love the fact that it 's organic , as well as the fact that the pizza dough is gluten - free ... sure beats having my husband sneeze for an hour , after eating "" regular "" pizza . i will say , the pizza is pretty good ... and this is coming from a girl from chicago !"
5,everything i have tried here is awesome ! you ca n't go wrong with your choices ! service is ok . could be better . not very personable !
2,"food is ok - sometimes good - used to be great .   the service is terrible and a 25 minute wait for lunch on saturday at 1:00 ?   seriously ?   it seems the restaurant relies on takeout - hostess ignored folks waiting to get on the wait list ( irony intended ) to serve carryout customers - could the tips have an influence ? 
 we were finally seated - had shrimp pad thai and red chicken curry - the curry was very good , but shrimp was overcooked and the dish tasted substantially different from last visit .   the restaurant is incredibly loud , to the point of distracting .  
 we used to go here often , but will be eating at other places from now on when saturday shopping ."
2,"i was here once . a reasonably sized girl broke her white plastic lawn chair and tumbled to the ground . i averted my gaze and tried to focus on my overpriced mediocre eggs benedict . my friend just laughed and laughed . i guess i should have ordered the mimosas , too ."
4,"okay , so a group of us go out practically every friday to the same old places for beer and food , but mostly for beer . so to break out of the norm , i was in search of a place with excellent beer and good food and somewhat close to home . so onto yelp i go and came upon boulders , and the reviews were pretty good and definitely worth checking out . so we all pack into the car and head over to boulders . the parking is great , plenty of spaces to go around . you walk through the patio , not bad with all the misters , felt like i was in a rainforest , but very refreshing . so you walk a little further , watch the steps , and there 's your bar . very open , plenty of hightop tables and lots of tv 's . the beer menu was plentiful . it should make everyone from the microbrewer to the coors drinker happy . i was pleased because they had plenty of vegetarian meals , or dishes you can substitute meat for veggies ... and for you meat eaters out there , i was told the burgers were delicious and the waffle fries were soooo tasty . the staff was helpful and attentive as well . i would definitely add this into our friday night rotation . if you 're looking for microbrews , this is a place to check out . the atmostphere is kicking and just an all around good place to kick back ."
4,"as far as malls go - and i hate malls - this one is tolerable . just speed past the food court to avoid a cluster you - know - what . 

 if you like upscale , this is your place . me , i typically hit two to three stores and leave . but maybe that 's just my shopping style . 

 if you have the cash to blow , the time to spend and the desire to shop , then this is your mall ."
3,"i have to say i avoid this store as much as i can . i have lived in this same neighborhood for 15 years , so i have had to go to this store many times over the years . they just never understand customer service at this location .   it is very close to where i live but , i would rather drive a little further for fresh and easy . however , i this night i thought i would just stop here for a quick shopping experience .                                                            my boyfriend was really sick and i wanted to take him some fresh chicken soup that they make and sell here . so here i am at 6:45 at night on a weekday . one cashier is open , yes only one in a store that size ! ! !    mind you the store is packed .   the line is all the way down the frozen food isle .    there are 4 registers where you can check your self out / but , no one is there to help them ( all 4 busy ) ..     and it is winter in molasasville . so slow . i am sorry and do n't want to sound like i am above it all , but i do not have time to waste like this .                                                                          this is not a one time   experience either . this is one of the biggest reasons i hate going to this store . i have been to other safeways around the valley that are not like this .    the one on 7th street for instance . they never behave this way .    sorry to say i will continue to avoid this shop ! !"
4,"very excited to try this place out .   i tried the sampler of all 4 beers and really enjoyed them all ; however , the watermelon ale was my favorite .   great service , cool , relaxed atmosphere and delicious beer = a winner !"
5,"part of a social event , we only had app 's here . quite delicious crab cakes and a shrimp fritters with mango sauce . the portions were gigantic and actually big enough for a meal . i was slightly full afterwards . part of the roaring fork , wildfish franchise , they also offer a great happy hour . seems a bit high priced but our bill was taken care of , so i 'd save this ( for the middle class foodie ) for a special event ."
5,"okay , i admit it - we are waaaaay late to this party . we tried once before but the hour - plus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day . this time our strategy was to go early on a saturday morning as close to 6:30am opening as possible . we arrived around 7:15 ( it was the weekend after all ) and only waited about 20min for a table for two . 

 i had the special of the day - 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage , fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese - yum ! the sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked . my companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that . 

 great value for the price - i packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home ( who could not be roused at dawn ) . if you have n't been , get up early , bring a newspaper and rest assured matt 's big is well worth the wait ."
3,"a pretty big group of us came here for my bro 's bday and had a good time . 

 we had made reservations for a sat night , and when we arrived , we were immediately seated .   our server guy was friendly , quick and did a great job of attending to our large party . 

 the ambiance was more relaxed ( and less pretentious ) than i had expected ( considering you 're in old town scottsdale ) , so i appreciated that .   parking was easy .. not sure how we lucked out on great parking spots on a sat night in the area , but we did ! 

 the food : 
 my sister 's coconut fish was very tasty .. addictive probably because of the creamy coconut milk and the sugar they obviously added .. still delicious . 
 my pork lettuce wraps were tasty and i had the option of getting them with red / purple leaf cabbage , which was a nice change .   the meat was savory and seasoned well and my portion was so big , there was no finishing it . 
 my bro 's seafood curry was a hefty portion ( as were all the rest of the dishes in our party ) but i was n't a big fan of the flavor . 
 my hubby 's spare ribs were overly - flavored ( yes , that does exist ) and i did n't enjoy the bite i had . 

 i m not sure how authentic this thai food is , but it was tasty ... thai food is quite healthy ( yes , i do believe coconut fats are healthy ) , but all the sugar added for flavor enhancement of the currys is not very thai .. nor appealing to me .   for a once - in - a - while occasion , i 'd go .. but it 's not really on my "" must go back "" list , sadly ."
4,a few co - workers and i were in town for a conference and decided to check out this place on a tuesday for lunch .   service was fast and the sandwiches were good .   the bread was fresh ... i would suggest splitting because a whole sandwich is just too much for a regular appetite .
4,"the breakfast club is as good as you 'll find . the blueberry pancakes are superb , their coffee is beyond description . for a change of pace , try their eggs benedict , southwestern style . a great spot within walking distance ... a beauty ."
5,"dr. ken danyluk and his team offer an extraordinary orthodontic experience .   team orthodonitcs offers many orthodontic soluitions for all ages .   whether patients choose traditional braces , invisalign or "" hidden brace "" lingual braces behind their teeth , they always leave happy !"
4,"this place was unique for me because everyone seemed like they were inside smoking but it was an indoor outdoorish place .   there were heated lights and it was the only place that i found pretty crowded where if you walked the streets there were n't a lot of people .  

 the food was good , i had the steak fajita , which you ca n't go wrong because its just steak .   but i also had a fish taco which was pretty good .   my boyfriend had the pick three meal , so he picked tacos , chimichanga , and enchilada .   his choice was good and the chimichanga was delish .  

 the bathrooms were very rustic looking but it seemed to look that way , decent for a funky place like that . 

 they had live music friday night , where a guy was doing bad covers on a few good songs . 

 the waitstaff was overall nice and they checked back at us here and there . 

 overall i 'd go back if i was in around scottsdale again !"
1,"la grande orange grocery has a problem . it ca n't decide what it wants to be when it grows up , and that makes the overall experience iffy . is it a quick mart ? a grocery store ? a restaurant ? a coffee shop ? unfortunately , it ca n't be all of them . 

 i love la grande orange pizzeria , when there is table service , fun wait - staff , and delicious food . but during the day on the weekends , the grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate . it is not set up for the crowd , they do a poor job of line management , and when there is a line to order , the rest of the grocery is impossible to navigate . to top it off , the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready . unnecessary . 

 i 'll certainly be back at night for the pizza , the delicious wings , and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to lgo . but i 'm afraid that i wo n't be back for the weekend chaos ."
4,"a very inconspicuous   coffee shop located right below elizabeth arden 's red door spa . 

 they have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $ 3.00 . it was a bit ' ' watery ' ' for my taste but on a hot afternoon , it hit the spot . 

 wish they had sugar water to flavor it but did n't see it available ."
5,"thanks for the positive reinforcement talk , and explaining , i just need to take my time . thanks robin , you encourage me , 
 i have been sick , and so has my family . i have missed the last couple of weeks and boy can i feel the difference . you know when miss something for a period of time ? ? then you have to start all over , but that o.k . 
 thank you again jim and robin for taking those few extra minutes to ask me how i am doing and how my kids are since i have been gone . thanks so much for caring , weather its about my kids or my knees or the fact that i have a pain pump in my stomach and    have a hard time laying on my stomach , which robin saw i was not putting full weight down on my stomach . she asked me after class what was going on and if i was o.k. she made me feel important and cared about . where are you ever going to be working out and after class the teacher checks in with you , to make sure everything is alright . jim and robin love this practice and so do i. i feel what makes them different is the caring aspect . the checking in with you . if you ever have a question , jim and robin will always take the time answer questions or just see how you are doing ! ! ! thanks jim and robin ! i will be back soon ! ! ! ! thank you for being the best bikram yoga around and thanks for just being non - judgmental , caring , and hopeful for everyone in the class to push harder and just do it the right way ! ! ! ! love your studio , love robin and jim as people ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this is the perfect place to either start or to be challenged . 
 thanks , nicole skarderud"
4,"was not satisfied first trip , service was awful and place was deafening .   but we thought food was worth trying again .   so , now that the place has been open and matured it is much better .   our sever was good , the place was about 1/2 empty which made the noise level much more bearable . 
 food , very good .   not chicago family run good , but for the valley very good . 
 i asked for my shrimp to be spicy and it was .   hsb ca n't handle so hot and his curried duck was mild as requested .   the mustard wraps , unusual and tasty .   hsb loved the peanut sauce .   chicken and lemongrass salad , good flavors .   we will be back ."
4,"i stayed here with my family ( 3 people in 1 room ) for 3 nights .   what first attracted us was the rate , but what made us happy with the choice was the cleanliness , coolness ( literally -- good air conditioning ) , and accessibility of the hotel .   it 's wheelchair accessible .   the best part of the hotel is the staff .   the front desk team was incredibly helpful -- much more so than you typically see at a chain hotel -- and they gave us regular maps / handouts as well as printouts that were tailored individually for our needs .   even more astounding , though , was the cleanliness of the room : the staff cleaned the room so well after our first night that when we returned on day two , it looked like we had just walked into the room for the first time .   ( in my experience , most hotels do a better clean - up job in between guest stays rather than do a good job every single day , but these folks are the exception . ) 

 reasonable , hot breakfast .   eggs , swine , cereals , pastries , juice , milk , coffee , fruit , yogurt ...   you 've had it a million times , but they do it just fine . 

 the definition of 4 stars is "" yay !   i 'm a fan . ""   and that 's true .   did n't give it 5 stars because it 's not "" woohoo !   as good as it gets ! "" to me -- mostly a product of the location and lack of distinctiveness as a hotel experience -- i would only give 5 stars to an excellent "" destination hotel , "" and that 's not this place ."
5,"celebrated my anniversary here . everything was amazing . enjoyed the filet mignon and the lobster with prawns . luis was our server and made our experience truly amazing . he made everything perfect . he gave us our space , but at the same time entertained us when appropriate . he recommended a great wine to pair with the lobster , and made sure we were well taken care . we capped our meal off with creme brulee and a dessert wine . we will definitely come back here and ask for luis again ."
4,"good , quick option in downtown phoenix . we dined here before a suns game and we got in and out with great service and delicious food in under 45 minutes . the pho was very good , as was the noodle dish i ordered ."
5,"excellent place for a nice dinner , a classy place to bring friends for cocktails and food"
5,"going to desert botanical garden is the perfect field trip for a beautiful day like today ... i 've been to dbg a handful of times for events , exhibit openings , meetings , and of course yelp in bloom ( a yelper party that i planned a couple of years ago ) ... but today i went with my son and we met some other friends with the sole purpose of checking out the butterfly exhibit . 

 we did n't get lucky enough to have a butterfly land on us , but we did see tons of gorgeous butterflies .   there were orange butterflies and yellow butterflies and striped butterflies , etc ... the flowers in the pavillion are pretty to look at as well .   we visited the gift kiosk afterward and took home a butterfly finger puppet , which i know we will get tons of use from ( only $ 6.25 ) . the exhibit runs until may 13th , so do n't miss it ! 

 and if you do find yourself with more time while you 're there , definitely check out the design for a living world exhibit as well ... i saw that when it first opened and it was really cool .   the photography alone is worth a visit . 

 i just wish i had more time to explore dbg more often !"
3,"i have been to this restaurant several times .   i can say it has been better each time with the first time being absolutely terrible .   why did i return ?   because i was with a friend who wanted to try it and i could n't believe it would be so bad the second time .   it was a bit better and most recently it was good .   the hostess initially was very "" french "" in that she was affected and snooty and yes , a young american woman .   initially we had a very bad experience with a fire alarm that continually went off , the staff did n't apologize and did not comp us anything .   other diners just left without paying or waiting for their meal .   it has since been better , but i certainly am reluctant to return .   there are many other restaurants from which to chose !"
5,"was i ever lucky to pick dr . karawi from a random list of doctors near my home from my insurance website . 

 ever since i was a kid , i barely remember seeing my dentist . his hygienist came in , cleaned my teeth , then the dentist came in with his long nose hairs and big belly and bald head and stinky breath and started shoving sharp metal objects into my teeth . then he left , saying only "" hmmph "" . he had a beach house in the cayman islands . 

 dr karawi is exactly opposite of that ( do n't know if he has a house in the caymans though ) . what really , really , really surprised me was the karawi cleaned my teeth .... the dentist ! he does that for all his patients . i asked him why , and he just said he likes to get to know his patients . how novel ! 

 he is extremely friendly and likeable but always professional . he will joke and talk to you about your vacations , plans for the weekend , etc , but then always keeps it serious when discussing your dental care . i sincerely appreciate his services and friendliness . we liked him so much , even invited him to our house warming party ! 

 so for excellent dental care and outgoing service , dr. karawi is your man . 
 p.s . he 's not bald , does n't have long nose hairs or a big belly , and his breath does n't stink ."
4,"ok , i 'm somewhat between 3 stars and 4 stars on this .   i really want to like this restaurant a lot so maybe i will have to return again and try another dish . 

 positives : 

 price ! ! ! !   wow , the prices are amazing .   i got the hand pulled spicy noodle dish ( $ 4.00 ) , my boyfriend got the hand pulled pork noodles ( $ 5.95 ) and we shared the pork dumplings ( $ 4.95 ) . 

 the dishes provided rather generous portions ( we ended up taking half of our meals to go ) .  

 the dumplings were quite tasty ( approx 8 large dumplings ) 

 i got the passion fruit smoothie with boba which was quite good ( i love bubble tea so much and this place is pretty legit ) . 

 the restaurant was really clean and the window to watch the noodles being made was really interesting and ingenious ! 

 negatives : 

 my noodle dish just really did n't have a whole lot of flavor and was not even remotely spicy for being titled ' spicy noodles . '  

 all of the food was really rather greasy .   the sauce for the noodles was pretty much pure oil and the dumplings / sauce were pretty oily too ( but still tasty ) .   i was just hoping for a bit of a cleaner feeling meal instead of heavy greasy food .   maybe if i try one of the soup dishes next time i will have better luck !  

 the experience was overall a good one and i would like to try this place again , i was just a bit disappointed with the grease content of the foods which gave me a bit of stomach ache .   regardless , this place is worth a shot !"
5,"been twice . authentic , high quality & great price for what you get . salsa de chile de arbol was the best ! ! loved the decor . orchata tasted fresh , which is a rarity in most mexican restaurants ."
5,had the meat pizza last night and it was truly one of the best pizzas i 've had in a long time .   the owner is always very welcoming and warm hearted !
2,"this place screams , "" no "" !  

 indoor seating ?   no .   i ate outside in the heat .  

 water ?   no .   i asked for a cup of water with my meal and was told they only have bottled water and soda for sale .  

 straws ?   no .   i walked to safeway to get a gatorade and they do n't even have a straw for me to use .  

 can i use the now groupon for a 14 "" pizza ?   no .   only good for the 12 "" .   the groupon was n't clear and the cashier did n't tell me that until after i ordered and bought the groupon , which i told him about when i walked in the door .  

 to add insult to injury , all toppings cost extra .   some are $ 1.90 each .   plan to spend a lot of money and be underwhelmed with mediocre pizza if you do n't head the warnings posted here ."
5,"i will continue to give this place five stars for so many reasons .   first , the menu is very creative , and offers a great variety of healthy food , with an asian twist .   this time i had the shrimp curry , which had lots of fresh vegetables , and instead of a heavy cream curry , it was a much healthier broth curry .   we had the edamame dumplings again , which were as good as i remembered .   it was kind of cool to see dr. weil eating there last night .   it 's good to know that he likes the place enough to dine there ."
2,"the "" chicken burger "" with jerk sauce was gross . it was dried out with terrible flavor . the only saving grace was that it was small , which says enough right there . as another reviewed said , it was a ground chicken patty when i was expecting a grilled chicken breast after going to places like johnny rockets where i believe they have a similarly named section of the menu that refers to chicken breast sandwiches . i realize i have myself to blame on that misunderstanding , but it was still a terrible sandwich ."
4,"clean , modern hotel with spacious suites including decent sized refrigerators ( easily accommodates a 30 pack ) . 
 staff was fantastic and went out of there way to work around hiccups . local shuttle , free breakfast , managers reception in the evenings ; and all within walking distance of scottsdale stadium ."
5,"i was given a $ 100 gift card to use at willow stream spa last december ... i 've been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then .   well , guess what ? today was that day ! 

 with my fiance out of town for the weekend , i took advantage of some much deserved "" gabi time "" as i like to call my downtime .   i called a few days ago to make an appointment and i asked if there were any specials going on .   lucky for me , there were several !   the one that was most appealing to me was the "" book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it . ""   i chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it ... i was in heaven ! 

 i 'll back up a moment and just say that i 've been to the willow stream spa before ... years ago .   today was even more heavenly than i remembered .   i checked in around noon and did n't leave until after 6 pm .   i could 've stayed longer , but i had to come home to take minnie out ! 

 the willow stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine ... i started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial .   i had tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck , back , and shoulders ... ( i 've been having shoulder pain so i think she customized this based on my situation ) .   she was fantastic but with just 30 minutes , it felt like a tease ... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss !   heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job .   i highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as i fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders , chest , neck , scalp , hands and feet ... the products felt amazing and smelled good too .   so much so that i bought a couple on my way out .  

 after my services , i had lunch ( a delicious salad with veggies and chicken ) while i wrote some thank you notes and read my book ... it was so peaceful .   it was like an escape from the world and i enjoyed every second of it ! 

 so , bottom line - if you are thinking about getting a spa - lover like me a gift anytime soon , willow stream spa giftcards are always welcome ... what an experience !   i 'm feeling energized , relaxed , and peaceful ."
4,this place has consistently good food on every visit . lots of choices and really fast service ! lucky to have this so close to work . check the soup and sandwich combo . salad bar rocks too .
5,"full disclosure : one way or another , i have only been to roaring fork for the happy hour , but the happy hour is darn good . you can , and you should , get that kettle of green chili pork or the big - ass burger , or better yet , share the two with someone nice . the huckleberry margarita is so good , i 've had three in one sitting ( no , i was n't driving ! ) . i fully intend to get over there for dinner soon , because i keep seeing the sugar cured duck on the menu and just thinking about it right now my mouth is watering . it gets pretty busy during the happy hour , though , so be prepared to wait a little if your party is large ."
4,"another indoor ( two - story ) westcor mall that has gone through a few minor changes over the years ( updating the restrooms in the food court area , adding dick 's as another anchor store , adding the kid 's play area , etc ... ) . it 's also seen many big and small retailers come and go too . 

 when this mall opened back in 1994 , robinsons - may was the only store open before the rest of the mall . there were empty fields in the surrounding areas and orange grooves in other parts . it 's hard to believe , but the only restaurant open at the time in the area was applebee 's across the street . 

 fast forward to today , the mall still attracts shoppers from all over , since it 's the only indoor mall in the west valley ( not counting desert sky mall - don't go there ! ) . 

 anchor stores : macy 's , forever 21 ( in the former mervyn 's building ) , dick 's sporting goods , jc penny 's , sears ( formally montgomery wards ) , and dillards . 

 amc movie theater is located inside the mall . 

 besides the food court , there is a chevy 's , johnny rockets , and miracle mile deli . 

 some newer retailers include : sephora , coach , disney store ( they came back ! ) , apple , swaroski , and j. jill . the mall stays pretty full of retailers , once in awhile , there are a couple of empty stores , but not for very long . 

 this is still a popular family friendly mall to visit and shop . westcor keeps it updated and clean ."
5,"note : ignore the reviews above . it looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place . yes , this owner used to own udupai cafe and udupai cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery .   if you read my other reviews , you know that i 'm critical and   my attention to detail is there so i 'm not one of these people who likes every place he eats at . 

 positives 
 i 'm indian and i can assure you this place is good . i have never been to udupai cafe but based on its failing health inspections , i would be scared to eat there . woodlands is a nice clean eatery in a nice part of chandler .   it 's not a restaurant .   it 's basically a dosa shop . they   specialize in dosa and offer several types . they also have excellent indian chinese dishes .    the food is consistently good and i have eaten there on several occassions .   this is a lunch / light dinner place .   do n't think of this place like a restaurant .   there are several types of dosa and that 's what this place specializes in .   the restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so do n't worry about failing health codes here ... at least not for a while . 

 negatives 
 their non - south indian dishes are not so good . for non - indians , they should be informed that this is a dosa house so order dosa and other south indian dishes .   do n't order your typical indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer ( it was n't good here ) .    the owner also says every dish is excellent which is n't true ; he is kind of a businessman so he does n't really care about telling you which dishes stand out .   stick to the dosa and the vegetable manchurian .   their mango shake was n't very good . their chiku shake is great ."
4,"had the pleasure of enjoying house of tricks last night , for the second time in the past twelve months . 

 with a party of six , i was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices .   the restaurant , found in tempe near asu , is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating .   the outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees / greenery , the setting works quite well .  

 our party was seated immediately and without problem , the night was off to a solid start .   our waitress , jamie , was both friendly and courteous .   jamie had a great understanding of the menu , the specials and especially the wine .   her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly .   each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went . 

 i had the pork belly , on jamie 's suggestion . other choices within our party included the salmon cake , sweetbreads two ways , and the scallops .   i thought the pork belly was great . it had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed .   the scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly .   the sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown .   as a lover of sweetbreads , i have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation . these were just not that great .   they were n't cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking .   this would be the only lacking dish of the evening . 

 for the entree , i had the pork osso bucco .   this was a real treat , cooked evenly , tender and tasty .   other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna , the salmon , and the duck .   the tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes .   both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied .   my companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish , she found the duck slightly fatty .   all around , the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned .  

 with little room left for dessert , we ordered three selections for the table to share .   all were good and once again our plates were cleaned off .   the dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces .  

 all in all , this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service .   i would eat here again and recommend you to do the same ."
2,"blah is really all i can think of .   blah , blah , blah . 

 everything tasted the same .   everything !   i got an open chicken burrito which is basically a burrito in a bowl , opened .   it had chicken , rice , cheese , peppers , onions and the shell .  

 i ate a piece of chicken , tasted like the grill .   i ate some rice , tasted like the * * burnt * * grill . i ate an onion , tasted like the grill .   i are a pepper , tasted like the grill .   i ate the cheese , tasted like a burnt grill with cheese on top . 

 yuck !   i ate about 4 forks full and was so disgusted i had to chuck it . 

 fail of an airport dinner to the max !"
4,"i must admit , i 'm more of a wal - mart neighborhood market guy ( due to the economy ) , but i had a great time shopping at aj 's . every single item on the shelves is of the highest quality . for valentines day , because i 'm so bad at picking out girly gifts , i let my girlfriend go on a shopping spree at the chocolate counter ( among other things) ... i'd go back once in a while , but did grimace at the checkout counter when i forked over $ 125 for three bags of crap ... i guess it 's back to mayonnaise sandwiches at neighborhood market ."
1,"until they get their quality under control , we wo n't eat here except for lunch . we ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken . the problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least 10 whole peppercorns on each of our plates . i actually bit into to one before i realized that the sauce was just crawling with them . they could 've strained them out , processed them in , whatever , just do n't serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns . this tasted nothing like the previous visit when i ordered the same exact dish . when we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable , he said the best he could do was a 20 % discount . well . we   were n't looking for a free or discounted meal , but rather some acknowledgement that they actually cared about the food . that never happened . unless something changes , the burgers are decent and that is about it ."
2,"meh . 
 maybe it was just that we decided to dine in 10 minutes prior to closing , but i was definitely not impressed . i had not been here in ages . probably 10 years , maybe 15 . no exaggeration . i remember nothing but good things about miracle mile . i remember being excited to come eat here . 
 so one night while shopping at arrowhead with a friend , i got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and thousand island dressing . i was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu ! i did n't have to special order it ! 
 it was a good size sandwich .   big enough that when cut in half , you still have to use both hands . i took my first bite and was immediately disappointed . not that it was bad . it 's just that i had fond memories of this place and i was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the # 19 at langer 's in downtown l.a ..... or at the least like gandolfo 's in tempe . nope . it was nowhere near as good as either restaurant .   it was just okay . the bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread . the meat was chewy and lacking flavor . the coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch . the flavor of the coleslaw was not strong , but still masked the flavor of the pastrami . i will stick with jason 's or heidi 's next time i have a hankerin ' for another deli style sandwich ."
3,"my wife and i stopped by last weekend to watch football and sample a couple of their brews .   the food was great could be some of the best french fries i 've ever had .   the beer was good .   noticed almost everyone drinking the house beers so it was nice to see that kind of support for an established micro brew .   there was a large crowd for football many folks wearing jerseys and everyone really getting into their game .   if your looking for an energetic place to watch football and grab a good bite this would be a place to consider . 

 updated 04/05/2012 lowered to 3 stars . 

 i have been here a couple times since my first review and it really is just an average place .   the fries are the highlight .   the place is small , loud and well your average pub or brewery ."
5,"this is a great mma gym .   instructors are profesional , the facility is clean , and they work well with all experience levels ."
3,"i 've been here a grand total of three times , and i probably wo n't be returning any time soon .   it 's not that the food is flat out bad , per se , it 's just that there are many better options nearby . the first time i went on a recommendation , and the food was ... ok . the 2nd time i went the food was still only ... ok . the third time ... well , you get the picture . 

 the first obvious knock against rosita 's place is the chips and salsa . they 're not bad , but they 're not complimentary . given all the competition which offer free chips and salsa , you 'd think these would have to be pretty darn special , but they 're not . good , but not outstanding . 

 secondly , the rice and beans are just ok ( that descriptor keeps coming up in this review ) . the chicken enchiladas were fresh , but lacked any real flavor or spice . the machaca , which is supposed to be   one of their specialties , was soggy ... a big no - no for a dish that is a specialty in this region . 

 so , honestly , while i would n't discourage anyone from going here , i 'm not sure what some of the hype is about , especially when rito 's , tacos de juarez , and comedor guadalajara are n't that far away ."
4,"i have to admit , the reason i gave this place 4 stars instead of 3 is a ) i want it to stay in business ( which can be hard on mill these days ! ) and b ) it 's one of the few places on mill where you can bring your child without feeling like you may get heckled . ;) lol now , i definately enjoy a night out without the babes too , but this is a place i go for happy hour with my husband and daughter . the beer / wine is good , the food is good ( i like the southwestern egg roll apps ) , the price is good , the service is good , and the atmosphere is nice ( thought i was going to say good , huh ? ) . we love to sit on the patio and people watch ."
4,"this place has a great location . hidden away in old town next to the art park of scottsdale . perfect place to take an out of towner . 

 i suggest sitting outside . they have misters , of course , and umbrellas . inside is just a little too cramped for me . 

 portions are huge ! not complaining . you are def .   getting your moneys worth . 

 on weekends make sure to come early- this place gets packed out ! 

 overall , a great breakfast / brunch place and good place to get rid of your hangover ! ... plus being a georgia girl- pbr tall boys woop woop"
5,stopped in looking for some break from the heat after a couple hours shopping .   they have a happy hour menu that we tried several dishes from and all were very good .   menu also has a good selection of alcoholic drinks nut we stuck to h2o hydration instead .   staff and management were very attentive .   would definitely recommend .
4,"in the interest of full disclosure the only thing i every really go here for is the lunch buffet but wow , what a great buffet ! i believe the buffet itself is about $ 10 and for that you get a wide range of vegetarian items and as with other items on the buffet most of those get changed out over time so you get a rotation of various dishes as you come back . they also have hummus and baba ghanoush ( like hummus but made with eggplant instead of chickpeas ) . there is generally at least one dish with red meat ( today it was a tomato based stew with eggplant and either beef or lamb ) and usually two dishes with chicken . 

 i generally get iced tea to go with the meal and one thing to note , they do not serve alcohol so if you want to go someplace where you can also have a drink or two , this would not be a good place to go but if you just want a place with really good middle eastern food ( the owners told me it is really lebanese cooking but i 'm going to just generalize and say for most of us , when you try it , you will think middle eastern ) . of course , you can walk a block or two to 4 peaks brewery , in the same area , and have a drink or two before or after you your meal . 

 one really nice thing about this place it is right off the apache stop on the light rail and right across the road ( same side of the street ) is pita jungle so a wide range of good food options right off that light rail stop . 

 bottom line , i 've never had anyone i 've taken here not like it and everyone who has gone has wanted to go back again . i like it for lunch during the workday because it is quick and you have a wide variety of regularly changed out tasty food options , so i recommend you give it a try if you have the time . :-)"
4,"i went to this place the night before my birthday , after making 3 u - turns and k - turn ... after reading all the good reviews about this place , i expected to see a lighted up sign at the least to make the average driver realize where to turn ... other than that it was great food , looks can be deceiving , looks like a run - down cafeteria but the food was amazing , the bbq beef brisket were tender and melt in your mouth , the pork ribs was delicious , the family size cole slaw was ridiculously small , i thought i was in france ordering es cargo .. but overall good food"
5,we were greeted with very friendly staff .   we had the fried knocci for an appetizer with a fabulous marinara sauce - usually do not order knocci but these came recommended and were very good .   the bread was crusty on the outside & chewy on the inside -very yummy .   we sat at the bar as we usually do and the bartender brought over a sample of their meet sauce to try with more bread .   i do n't eat meat sauce but my husband said it was very good .   i had a heft cosmo & my husband had a beer .   for dinner i had the pasta trio that was fabulous - probably the best italian food i 've had since the cioppino at allesia 's restaurant .   my husband had the linguine with white clam sauce also very good .   i 'm certain these pasta dishes were homemade because they just had amazing flavor - i wanted more ! ! we finished with tiramisu that was also really great .   my husband had coffee and even that was great .   a little pricey in my opinion for italian food but due to how great all of it tasted -   we think it was worth it .   this will be a definite dining destination in the future .
4,"i love this place . what can i say ? 

 richard cho not only has some of the best customer service skills i have ever seen ( that guy has an amazing memory for names ) but some of the most creative approaches to making sushi in the valley . i love coming to sushi eye , i have never had a bad experience in all the years i have been going to the 2x new times best of phoenix award winner . 

 the use of macadamia nuts is brilliant and an amazing addition to many of the creative rolls that are available . the spicy scallop roll is a go to for sure . they have ( and i know this sounds stupid ) the best california rolls in arizona . as pedestrian as that roll is , the california roll is transformed in to a very dessert style treat when ordered at sushi eye . seriously , do it . 

 go check it out , introduce yourself to richard and be amazed when he remembers your name . you will be amazed by the food as well ."
4,really fast and friendly service even during busier moments . the staff is also very helpful when asked to assist with using copiers and finding appropriate mailing supplies .
5,"went back to true foods ( i have been doing this a lot since my first trip ) with my mom for dinner last week . it was amazing as always however this time was different . i tried a new menu item , the bison burger ( i highly reccomend this ) it was so tastey and very light for a burger . omg ! i want to say that this time was different because we had the best service ever ! our server marcus was amazing . he was very informative , helpful , polite and everything you would expect from a server and then some . love this cat . just thought i would give credit where it is due . too many times you read about the negatives on service and not so often the positives . i work in a restaurant and know it 's important for employers to know who their "" stars "" are . marcus is your star . a bright , and shiney star . lol 

 loves : shitaki mushroom lettuce cups , ahi sliders , spaghetti squash , kale salad , raviolli , green tea , coffe ( black ) and i always have to have the banana chocolate tart . definitely ."
5,"it 's the best !   downstairs , hanging at the bar , you ca n't beat it !  

 the food is excellent ! ! !"
1,"one star is far more than they deserve .   the owner of the property spent an excessive amount of time barking out reminders of hotel policy , was rude to guests and his staff .   the stay here felt more like being in prison with the warden constantly in your face .   people in the group that stayed were locked out of the room by management , forced to pay made up fines .   the owner ruined the entire experience .   if this is how customers are treated , this place wo n't be around long ."
5,"this place is great ! ! ! they grow alot of the food they use and if they do not grow , they buy it local ! ! ! the food tastes great ... don't forget to get a milkshake . it is also a great place to sit and eat outside , nice !"
5,"i just had my first tammie coe cake last week for my birthday , and i will never be the same again .   i do n't normally eat cake , in fact , if it 's not brownies , i do n't eat it .   but this cake drew me in with it 's appealing fondant .   from there , i got lost in the spongy richness of the cake .   a cornicopia of flaverful goodness . 

 so make a metal note to yourself , i will only eat brownies and tamie coe cakes . 

 oh , and special thanks to arts g ( previous review ) for telling me what the hell fondant is .   i was just calling it "" sheet like frosting "" ."
4,"while i do n't like to hype places up ( because really , how good can any one place be ) ... how good can one burger joint be over another , or how good can pizza be over another pizza place ( when weighing the ones that are all generally good in the public opinion ) .   now the word around town is that the grind is sofa_king great .   i will say about the grind that when you 're up for a burger , this place hits the spot .   i 've been here once before august 2010 ( do n't remember what burger i had but recall it was good ) and the other night i had the peppercorn burger and it was as good as it gets .   i was starving and really had n't eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot , but make no mistake , it was really good and i do enjoy this place for the atmosphere , service , and quality of food .   my friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot .   the sweet potato fries ( we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries ) and they were good . 

 as for some other areas to review : the atmosphere is nice .   it 's casual and not too dark and not too light inside .   ( that 's how i like it ) .   there 's multiple flat panel tv 's above the bar , so plenty of games on at any given time ( that 's also how i like it ) .   the service is fine ( although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service .   that 's often going to be the case with most casual establishments - so sometimes it 's good , and sometimes not to our satisfaction ) .   such is life !   anyway , back on track here , the wait staff and bar staff have been worth the 20 % tip both times .   no complaints by me about this place , however i do see some 2 and 3 star ratings on here .  

 where i will dock 1 star and sort of agree with kristi d.   she mentioned the large photo of sheriff joe arpaio on the wall ( while i sense that kristi does n't care for sheriff joe , i 'm neutral about him ) , but i agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in the grind .   i 'd much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall - and not photos of sheriff joe , mark grace ( for those who do n't know , he 's a former baseball player ) , and the mayor of paradise valley , all holding their burgers .   who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers .   i think i 'd be more ok with having these photos above me , but they are huge enlargements and a bit overkill .   and they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause .   look , i 'm all for causes and shit , but i would n't spend my money on a 36 inch enlargement of these local "" notables "" holding a burger .   the whole concept is pretty stupid .   but hey , i 'm generally uptight and been doing photography 20 + years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall . 
 
 side note :   for those who might have previously had "" liked "" the grind on facebook but no longer have their page as a like , it 's because they apparently had their group page hacked , so they had to start over .   i found this out when i liked it the other day noticed there were only about 165 like 's , and certainly i knew this place was way more popular than that .   when i commented that , they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over .

5,love love love this place . it 's a very healthy place to eat and always has awesome food and awesome service !
4,"yum . only wish this place was closer to my side of town so i could eat there more often .   babbo ( does n't this mean santa in italian ? ) is a neighborhood italian food joint that gives you big , tasty portions of food for little prices . 

 my friend and i always go here with her fam when she 's in town , and i always look forward to it . the menu is filled with tons of pastas and all the regular italian fare you 'd expect to find , but they also have some great , unexpected desserts . 

 they have this apple calzone that is so freaking good , but the only downside is that it takes forever to cook .   order it while you 're still eating your dinner so you wo n't be sitting there for another 30 minutes waiting on it . they also have a huge half baked cookie dessert kinda like the amazing one at oregano 's . and while it 's not as good , it comes pretty close . the desserts are ginormous , so sharing is best ."
5,"i have been to every ballpark in the cactus league and know my way around them all .   this is , by far , the best facility in all of spring training ( that includes the florida parks ) .   granted , i am a dodger fan and we get it better than the ' sox fans do , but it is still amazing . 

 camelback ranch is the brand new , state of the art , spring training facility for the dodgers and white sox .   the sox moved from tucson because tucson is the literally so bad that even people from chicago wo n't stay there .   the park is located just south of the glendale airport and pretty much only has one way in or out - 111th ave .   you can avoid camelback rd by taking indian school to 111th and then just drive into the stadium . 

 the grounds feature 13 practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields .   while the white sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public , the dodgers ' are wide open and inviting .   players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans .  

 the field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive .   not only do they have a full jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out $ 90 per game .   that price gets you seats behind home , access to unlimited food , wine , beer , soda , and sweets .   it also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off .   it sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money . 

 the grass seats have a great slope to them ( much like scottsdale ) and the seat aisles are wide .   the food selection is lacking without dodger dogs , however .   the stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that maryvale and peoria feature .  

 a great stadium and surely one to visit every march ."
5,"i have memories that make my mouth water .   my mother calls me everytime she passes through phoenix to ask me where this place is .   she tells her friends in los angeles to come here if they have business or family trips to phoenix .   they all rave after their experience .  

 the fry bread house is as authentic as it gets .   indian tacos , fry bread with sugar , and oh my god -- the red chili stew .   i think i just drooled a little on my keyboard .  

 the place does get a little cramped during meal times , but we used to take ours to go and sit in the park after a bike ride down central and picnic away and then do our best to ride it off afterwards so we were n't wallowing in the guilt of our deep fried pleasures .  

 make sure they are open before you make the trek , they have funky hours ."
5,"as a massage therapist i normally would rather have a massage than get adjusted , that was before dr. hunt came to town .   i trust him implicitly , and the techniques he uses are amazing . i take my four year old to see him too , who always greets dr. hunt and larissa with great big hugs . highly recommend this office , truly feels like family"
5,"this is the best library in the valley and one of my favorite places to study .   the interior design , water fall , glass elevators and many other features make this the perfect metropolitan library for our downtown . 

 the top level is pretty quiet and has beautiful views of the city .   quick tip : it seems that the southern part of the building is hotter because of the sun so i always sit on the north part of the building ."
5,"this is a real find and i mean "" find ""   because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown glendale . this small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine , not many polish restaurants around .   the food is flavorful and fresh , the soups are unique and tasty .   the stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stew . the owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing .  

 my only disappointment is the limited hours , i work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week .   definitely worth the trip ."
5,"i love love love paws salon . i used to take my dog to canine preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey , so i thought i 'd try a new place and i am so glad i did . the owner tracy clearly has a passion for animals . walking in you are greeted by a cat , dog , and macaw that call the front of the shop home . you are able to see them grooming the dogs ( a big plus for me , you never know what some places do behind closed doors ) . she is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady ( in a good way ) . she 's to the point , tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help . they keep track of the previous cut that was given ( it 's annoying some places you to have to tell them every time ) . i would highly recommend this pet salon . they also offer daycare , and overnight boarding . i ca n't want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more ! ca n't go wrong at this salon .."
4,"carmel bianca ! ! ! oh my effin gosh ... that 's the stuff ! it 's yum . i 'm a fan of white chocolate flavored coffee so maybe i 'm bias and why i simply enjoyed my 16 oz of carmel bianca goodness . it 's simply espresso , steamed milk , white chocolate and carmel drizzled on top . and that 's the signature drink of dolce espresso . 

 thanks to yelp i decided last night after a driving lesson with l that i was too tired to drive home without something to pick me up ... and that was reason enough to make the short trek to dolce because i 've always wanted to try it . was n't exactly sure where it was , and happy to find that it 's just across from padre 's next to a psychic place . dolce has a cool vibe with music videos playing . and they 're good songs too ... like i had never seen pitbull 's "" the anthem "" video ... liked it ! enjoyed my carmel bianca with a slice of their chicago style cheesecake . i liked the cheesecake because it was different in taste compared to other cheesecakes , it was like a marzipan with cheese frosting on top ... so it was interesting . not really a fan of the german choc that my friends k and d got . i thought it was dry ... yuck ! 

 it 's a small place that 's bright , with four flat screens spread about . the owner , cesar ( i think ) was a sweetheart ! i just hope dolce survives as a 24 hour cafe on weekends because this place has potential . it 's way better than counterculture cafe back in the day . this is like the best place to go after the bars if you need a pick me up before heading home to the eastside from central phoenix . prices are moderate . so pls check this place out and spread the word ... love it and i 'll be back !"
4,"every culture has their comfort soup .   american 's have chicken noodle , mexican 's have menudo and vietnamese have pho .   i must have been vietnamese in a past life . 

 pho is the national dish of vietnam and a staple at any vietnamese restaurant and pho avina has some of the best pho around .   let me warn you - this is n't an appetizer , this is a meal .   a big , steaming bowl of soup served with your choice of meat and noodles in a savory , almost sweet , broth .   the pho is served with a large plate of fresh basil , cilantro and bean sprouts ; the cilantro complimented the soup nicely .   i chose the chicken and shrimp and was pleasantly surprised with large shrimp and big chunks of all white chicken . 

 my eyes were bigger than my stomach , so i also ordered the deluxe vermicelli salad .   a salad of noodles , veggies , beef , chicken , shrimp , eggroll , sweet potato cake and fish sauce - toss together and enjoy .   i had it boxed up , but did nibble on a few items and the sweet potato cake is out of this world good . 

 i had come for the banh mi at the recommendation of a previous yelper .   they only serve the sandwiches monday - friday from 11 - 3 ; i had just missed them .   darn .   i will definitely be back to try the banh mi and a boba , there were soooo many delicious flavors to choose from except for the fresh durian - icky , icky , icky ."
4,"great service .   tasty food .   i like it for lunch because later , i can skip dinner .   their salad bar satisfies the vegetarian taste buds .   i like this place alot .   i think it lives up to the hype ."
4,"well , i was very excited to go to this event , however , not so excited when it was all over . the music was great and it is a very nice place . it really reminds me of vegas . however , it   was fashion week and we all thought that we would see models sashaying down the runway . but , no . no fashion at all . the wine was comp and it was very good , i give great praise for that !   but the samples of food were few and far between . the servers skipped out many times . not like most yelp events which are usually out the door great !   we ordered from the happy hour menu .   i fully agree lots of salt , but i think it was the soy sauce , it was the most salty .. i have ever had . there is very little parking here as well so be prepared for that as well .   all in all we had a good time . but , not as fabulous as most yelp events ."
4,"i was quite impressed very charming and kinda romantic to have a nice lunch , the service was friendly and attentive the lunch specials were good too ! the only disapointing thing is there is no soda fountain but other than that it 's all good the pasties were very tasty and i look forward to going back soon ."
4,"enjoyed lunch at the bar with my wife while on vacation .   the bartender was one of the owners , the wife half who works a full time job elsewhere and the rest of her free time at the restaurant . 

 nice beer selection , just the right size floor plan with great outdoor space , and you could feel the care the new owners put into the place . 

 great neighborhood cafe ."
4,great place for shows . excellent place for everyone .
4,"i always connect here because i fly us airways from las vegas .   but everytime i have a stop over here , other than a major back track to the bay area , i do n't really mind coming here because it 's a well maintained airport . it might look old but it is always clean . 

 i 'm only here about 1 or 2 hours at a time but i ca n't help but notice all these restaurants in here , if you 're hungry and do n't mind ' airport prices ' , never fear selection is here .  

 also be prepared to walk close to a mile to your connecting flight .   there 's long hallways here . do n't worry , they have standing walking escalators ."
3,"really solid lunch deals and pretty close to tex - mex which i still get cravings for from time to time . i had the spinach chicken enchiladas and they were nice . it was a ton of food ( of course ) so we definitely needed boxes for leftovers . if you 're in the neighborhood , it 's a solid deal and i 'd stop in again . my only wish is that they did a green sauce with the spinach chicken enchiladas . that would be heaven ."
5,"favorite pho in the phoenix area so far .  
 great , tender meat in my pho chin nam ( # 8) . 
 i see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so i 'll have to try that sometime soon .    
 nom nom . 

 friendly staff . 

 see ya there !"
3,"i wanted to add a review to the actual company 's website , but i could not figure it out . i 'm curious where all the testimonials came from . 

 i have mixed feelings on my experience . in the end , i think i ended up with some beautiful windows , though . my salesperson was very engaging . i felt pretty confident in my decision to go with american vision windows after that first experience . there was some miscommunication on scheduling the measurement , but it worked itself out fairly quickly . i started to lose confidence when i was told a specific date that my windows would be in , but never heard anything from the company four days after that date . when i called them to find out where my windows were , i was told they had just received them and they could schedule my install in 2 weeks . since i only had saturday install available , that was understandable . the friday before my install , they called to reschedule to the following weekend because the rainstorm ( that just occurred that day ) had put them behind two days . again , i guess that was fairly understandable , but i felt like the peon that was the easiest to push off . 

 luckily the installers did show up the following saturday on the earlier side of the provided time frame . i kind of do n't know what to say about the install . there were two guys , one seemed to know what he was doing , the other i had less confidence in . the job took 4 hours to install 6 windows . during the entire transaction i was never told how long the install would take , so i 'm not sure if that was normal or not . the two guys actually seemed to be fighting during the entire install . i believe the head guy was joking around with the other by basically telling him he sucked . i think the other guy was genuinely getting angrier and angrier . in all honesty , i was very uncomfortable being in my own house while the install was going on . i was a bit disappointed in the cleanup of the job . i ended up having to cleanup inside the window tracks and windowsills on the inside and brush off the sills on the outside . i do n't feel i should have had to do that . before they left , i was handed a survey to review the entire process ( salesperson , overall experience , install ) . i think that is a horrible practice that needs to be changed . i did n't want to sit there writing out a review on all of the above while the installer is waiting for me , and then hand it right back to him . what it did cause me to do is overstate my review because i 'm not going to give the installers 2 stars and hand the paper back to the person i just reviewed . 

 i ca n't say i would recommend this company , but i feel the way customer service has been going , it 's really a tossup on what you will get from any company . 

 p.s. i forgot to mention my plants . i have recently spent a lot of my own time and money on landscaping my backyard so this stuck out to me big time . i understand when installing windows it 's difficult to pay attention to the foliage below your feet , but i think some attempt to not trample all over the plants would be very much appreciated . for example , when washing the windows , i think an effort can be made not to stand directly on top of a plant and twist your foot back and forth . i 'm still hoping i do not loose a couple of plants due to the trauma they endured ."
4,"i came , i saw , i conquered . 

 would get five stars but parking here is difficult . no signs on where to park if u ca n't get in the iddy bitty teeny weeny parking lot . walked an extra mile just to get to the entrance on the echo side"
4,"this place looks a lot worse than it is . the poorly shot photos of their food on their windows and walls do not do them any favors . i wound up eating here by chance when i was bringing back a group of teens to the jcc a few doors down -- we had a few minutes for lunch before bringing the rest of the kids back to tucson . most of the kids wound up in the mexican place next door , and seeing as we were pressed for time , i decided that i d get some thai food since i love thai . i asked the lady in there if i could get something very quickly to go , she said no problem . i asked if i should get the pad thai or the yellow curry , she said get the yellow curry . so i did . she asked me how hot ( and knowing that i had a cold and wanted something kinda spicy , but also momentarily forgetting that i was in a thai restaurant ) i told her "" make it pretty hot "" . in retrospect , i might have used a bit more caution with that statement . i also ordered some crab puffs which i know is not authentic , but i was in the mood . the crab puffs turned out to be excellent . just different enough from your standard chinese food arrangement and yet still delicious with their different style dipping sauce . the yellow curry was amazing , albeit a little bit spicier than i would have liked on a normal day ... well , actually , it was a freakin inferno ... but it felt good to eat it with my cold and all . just be advised ;) would definitely go back next time i m in the area . my only complaints were that it took a little bit longer than i would have liked considering my situation , but had i been sitting down it would not have been a problem , and secondly the price was a little high i felt . it was after 3 ( so a late lunch , i guess ) and wound up having to pay the dinner prices . the two orders , without a drink came to about $ 15 . not terrible , but a little more than i would have liked to pay ."
5,"i love this place the more i go to it ! the service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called , mexican gumbo . holy schneikies it 's good ! ! ! ca n't beat the prices either ! if i had a choice of this place over chipotle , i would choose qdoba any day ! ! !"
3,"fair pricing and no upselling . these guys are good -- but be warned , it 's as busy as an angry beehive on monday mornings !"
5,"i stop here every monday night and negate two hours of spinning and yoga by indulging in mexican comfort food . my wife swears by the carne asado tacos ; the cheese enchiladas ring my bell . although i phone in my order , the parking lot is always an adventure . however , the one night a young hispanic girl celebrating her birthday in the restaurant 's limited outdoor sitting area insisted i come over for a glass of milk and slice of her cake negated all the encounters with strange transients ."
4,"we had the luxury of eating here over the past weekend and what a treat . i had the 8 oz . filet ( with the blue cheese on top ) and my wife had the 6 oz . both excellent ! side dishes ( starch / veggie ) were solid ! we ordered the house wine ( recommended ) and also cheaper by the glass than other featured items . 

 also , i am thrilled to see some of the newer restaurants coming to the area . having lived in carefree for almost 15 years ... seeing it start to boom in addition to offering restaurants with flavor instead of simply western decor really is nice .  

 waiter was extremely informative . i even joked that he could of probably been a voice over in some animated movie or tv commercial . 

  anyhow , thanks for a great night out . we plan on coming back next time we visit ... can't wait to try the seafood ."
5,"pei wei 's has nothing on the fabulous food at totts   the menu is awesome -- try anything ! !   the owner , young , is such a nice man and will always help you understand the menu or make recommendations .   in fact , one time we told him we wished a certain dish was spicier ( we really like hotttt food ) , and he told us to just ask next time we were in and they would make it spicier .   everything on the menu is fabulous , but some of my favorites are : 

 sweet and pungent chicken -- all time favorite 
 bourban chicken 
 twins pork"
2,"this is a tough one .   it 's probably the best filipino restaurant in the phoenix area .   but that 's not saying much , because the few there are here are really not good .   compare jeepney bistro to one of the places in filipino town ( los angeles ) , and they get blown away . 

 and , for the record , my wife is a filipina .   and she cooks much better than the chef here .   no contest .   a lot less grease / fat / oil , that 's for sure ! ! 

 also , their portions are a bit small .   bigger than a few other places i could name , but still small . 

 if you really want some filipino food , and you do n't know my wife to beg some from her , this is probably your best option without driving to la .   but do n't form your opinion of filipino food based on this place .   go to la and try bahay kubo natin , or some others , and you 'll get a much better idea of what the cuisine is about !"
2,"the "" protein pancakes "" are always a treat , but the "" california eggs benedict "" was just awful today .   the biggest disappointment were the hash browns though .   they tasted like shredded cardboard .   i am tired of going to a restaurant 20 to 30 times and getting such inconsistent results . 

 shame on you us egg !"
4,"after reading the other reviews , i thought perhaps i would weigh in - they seem to be all over the place .   the critics are correct that the decor seems dated .   to me , having grown up back east with this very sort of restaurant , it was charming .   the restaurant is particularly enjoyable to visit at night , when they turn on the lights in the garden .  

 i enjoy the layout of the dining room , although i agree it is a ' cooler ' experience to eat in the bar .   i guess some people could be offended that the staff sit down and eat in the bar when it is slow , but i 'm not one of those people - i think it adds to the charm .  

 i had a very late lunch yesterday - around 3 - thanks to an appointment that went on forever .   so we ended up heading to riazzi 's for a late dinner , around 8:30 .   at that time of the evening , the dining room was closed . , so we sat in the bar . 

 their service is truly one of the strengths of this restaurant .   on this night , they were unusually attentive - even for them . the waters came out immediately upon sitting down , then they took your drink order - as it should be . neither my iced tea or water ever got below half a glass .   this is something i occasionally find annoying at places where the staff draws a lot of attention to itself when they refill drinks - particularly when it interrupts the flow of conversation .   not at riazzi 's - they are attentive but unobstrusive .  

 their bread is my favorite restaurant bread in the valley - hands down . it is actually better than the italian bread i grew up eating back east in hartford , new york , boston and providence .   it 's so good that i wish they had loaves available .   you have to possess a lot of discipline not to fill up on the bread . 

 the salad is as others have described it - traditional , but fresh .  

 my favorite item on the menu is now listed under pizzas and described as a spinach pie .   this used to be listed under appetizers as the grass pie , but if you order a grass pie , they 'll still know what you mean .   it is a cheeseless pizza with spinach and arrabiata sauce .   confession :   i love all things arrabiata . but this combination here is perfect .   for about 1.50 ( i ca n't recall the exact figure ) , they 'll add mozzarella to it , but i 've never done that because it is perfect as it .  

 they bring you a healthy amount of tasty parmesan cheese , so you can always throw that on the spinach pie . 

 so , i had that . outstanding as usual . my wife ordered the penne primavera , which was very good .   last time i was there with my daughter , she had the penne with garlic and oil , which i thought was just superb .   simple , but perfect for a garlic fan like me .   i have a feeling most folks skip over such an entree in favor of something more elaborate , but i recommend it .  

 we did n't have an appetizer , and even though i would n't describe the portions as enormous , they were generous and neither of us could finish our entrees . 

 is riazzi 's going to be sexy for the young , hip crowd ?   probably not , although it is romantic at night with their lights and sunken / elevated dining room , and has the ' cool ' factor of the bar .   it totally hit my ' nostalgic for the east - coast italian restaurant ' needs .  

 i just wish the service at most modestly - priced valley eateries approached riazzi 's . you can get spoiled with the bread and service over here ."
5,i love this place i have been here 2wice and it puts of the others in the country to shame . i hope that i can volunteer here .
4,"i 'm so happy these guys are here . i work next door at gangplank , and the previous sandwich shop in this location was okay , but really started to slide downhill . planet sub totally renovated the place ( looks great ) , breathed new life into it , and came out swinging with a diverse and tasty menu . you can really tell they 're working hard to make this a great experience , and the sandwiches i 've tried so far have been excellent . look forward to going back soon !"
4,"i brought dd and her friend here today after a long day of summer camp and running around .  

 we showed up shortly before 3 p.m. for their pop in playtime , which is supposed to be from 10 am to 5 pm .  

 there are two rooms of bouncy house contraptions that are appropriate for children older than age 3 .   i do n't know if they have actual age or size restrictions , but kids younger ( and/or small kids ) would have a difficult time here .   one reason it would be hard for younger kids ?   there are specific instructions for the contraptions which they go over with the kids before they are allowed inside .   some have a max of 2 kids at a time ( the obstacle courses ) , some have a max of 6 .   one has a max of four , with three on the ladder and one going down the slide .   younger kids would likely need to be constantly reminded of the rules , as they can be a little rigid . 

 both my 4 year old and the 9 year old loved it here .   they both said they preferred it to jumpstreet .  

 the girls were bummed out when at ten minutes to 4 someone came in and said playtime would be ending in ten minutes .   then the guy said if parents wanted to know why , we could approach him .   upon approaching him , he said that two birthday parties were booked for 4 p.m. , so they were ending pop in playtime early .  

 some parents were very upset , having just gotten there less than 30 minutes prior .   dd was very disappointed .   it took a little prodding to get her to put her shoes back on and get ready to leave after only an hour of playing .  

 on the way out , some parents stopped by and talked to the shift manager .   she just handed out cards for another session since ours was cut short .   pretty cool ; we will use the cards to bring another neighborhood kid back with us . 

 there were just the right amount of kids here at this time of the day .   i can not imagine how nuts it must be here on a weekend or during summer mornings .  

 still , bring a book and some bottled water and sit on the sidelines ... or do as i did and run the obstacle course several times on the insistence of the kids .   ;)   it was fun !"

 love it .   the wines are good and they have drink specials ( $ 5 glasses ! ) and the place looks great , and it 's light railable !   the panini was good , not special , but the creme brule made me forget all about it .   and work .   and oil spills .   and life .   thank god my body 's innate intelligence did n't forget about breathing or bladder control .   those stayed intact . 

 and the bruschetta what what !"
5,"this is one excellent ethiopian restaurant , rivals anything i 've sampled in washington dc or seattle .   if i lived in phoenix , this would be a top-5 restaurant for me ( along with lo - lo 's chicken & waffles - yum ! ) . 

 lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu .   many of the entrees are offered as small portions ( $ 4.50-$6.00 each ) .   they suggest each diner order 2 - 3 of these to make a meal . kitfo and lamb tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many ethiopian restaurants , you can order combo plates ( meat combo , veggie combo , house combo plate etc . ) .   this made deciding on our meal a little more complicated , but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes . 

 our favorite dish ordered was the lamb tibs ( the spicy version with awaze spice paste ) .   lamb was soooo tender , and the spices were a delight - rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes .   good thing it comes as a full order - four of us were competing for bites ! !   we ordered a half portion of keye wott ( beef in a spicy brown sauce ) that was some of the best i 've ever had .   again , rich in flavor but not too spicy .   my favorite ethiopian meat dish is kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar ( servered raw or lightly cooked ) but with ethiopian spices .   lalibela 's was pretty good , just not transcendent like the lamb tibs or beef keye wott .   the vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils , gomen ( collard greens ) and spicy ( wott ) lentils . 

 staff was great - attentive , helpful service .   unlike some ethiopian restaurants , this one is very user - friendly .   although in some cases   the menu accommodates american tastes it does n't compromise on quality or authenticity .   one note on the injera ( sponge - like bread used to scoop up the entrees ) - it 's a mix of wheat flour and teff ( a grain indigenous to ethiopia ) and i do n't think it 's fermented like injera that is made with 100 % teff .   i 'm used to the latter , but you can argue lalibela 's injera does n't compete with the flavor of the entrees as much . 

 all in all , one of the best ethiopian restaurants i 've been to , and i have been to many in the states .   only problem now is whether my favorite ethiopian restaurants in seattle will still taste as good !   highly , highly recommended ."
5,"best cakes around ! 

 this may sound crazy , but i 've never actually been in this place .   but i 've tried so many different things they have .  

 my job goes through karsh 's for all the anniversary cakes , catering , and special events .   we get cookies , cakes , and other assorted pieces of heaven from karsh 's .   recently , my coworkers wanted to try something different .   they got an eclaire , cake balls , and mini rainbow cakes .   the rainbow cakes are the best thing to ever go in my mouth .   i could eat those for days .   they just melt in your mouth plus they 're covered with chocolate .   what ?   yes ! 

 my friends also got me a karsh 's cake for my birthday a few years ago .   i wish i had a picture of it .   it was so pretty with a butterfly on it .   and it tasted amazing . 

 though i 've never been a paying customer and i 've never walked through their door , i love this place and highly recommend it for any event you may be throwing ."
5,my favorite sushi restaurant ever ! i love their ama ebi nigiri ( sweet shrimp ) and always craving for more . for this visit i tried their dynamite scallop roll and salmon roll ( with asparagus inside ) and it was so delicious makes me craving for more . the pork ribs were very delicate and it was melting in your mouth ! what makes this restaurant to be my number one spot of japanese restaurant in the valley was the sushi chef service is superb ! they ran out ama ebi and i told the waitress that one of the reason i came there is for that ama ebi . the chef suddenly came back to me one hour later and said he saved one ama ebi for me ! ! ! what a service ! ! ! ! i 'm so thankful of this wonderful dining experience and will definitely become one of their regular customer ! ! love this place so much ! !
4,"this place is fast becoming a favorite happy hour stop for my fiance and i. service is friendly , the panini 's are delish and the bruschetta is to die for . anything with their yummy fig jam is amazing . i love the ambiance . very casual , trendy and lively with great outdoor and indoor seating . i 'd say service is on the slow side , but it 's understandable b / c the place is always packed . they have   pretty good happy hour deals . i will say that the parking situation kind of sucks ( valet only unless you want to park down the street ) . but other then that , i have no complaints and will definitely be back !"
2,"i agree with chris l. ; i was disappointed with the cafe .   granted , i was looking for a college - type coffeehouse where i could grade papers , and this place just did n't have that sort of lounge - y feel that even certain starbuck$$ have .   there was no background music being played , and even with my ipod / headphones on , i was distracted by nearby conversations .   i got much more work done at 3 roots near campus ."
3,it is a salad bar .
4,"love this place ! i was n't sure about it the first time , seeing that is in a strip mall , but like the saying goes do n't judge a book by it 's cover . 
 i order the chicken w/ green every time and have not been disappointed . egg rolls are wrapped in thin egg roll paper , spicy , & delicious . mango chicken & clay pot dishes are also excellent . 
 independent & yummy ."
5,we had brunch at el chorro today and it was wonderful . the patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters . the service was outstanding . the food was delicious . i had the creme brulee french toast - it was carb / sugar heaven . everyone else enjoyed their food . the eggs benedict came out perfect . the blt looked awesome . the fries were delicious . we will definitely be back .
4,"went there with the wife . lots of stuff for the ladies . i would lay off making any real purchase here on my own , i would of course consult the mrs. in regards to what she might like . way to tough to try and pick something out in here ( louis vuitton , gucci , etc . ) that is the stuff for the ladies to decide on . nice place , very friendly staff , warm , and inviting one to buy ."
5,love five guys !
4,"i discovered this hidden gem while shopping at tj 's and returned for happy hour between 4 and 6:30 from t - f.   the patio is in the afternoon shade and far enough off scottsdale road to avoid street noise . the seven tapas ( appetizers ) attracted my interest and i ended up selecting 1 ) ebi prawn with grilled fennel , 2 ) tartine of bouillabaisse and 3 ) medjul dates with merguez sausage , sugar cured bacon for the happy hour price of 3 for $ 10 vs the normal 3 for $ 15 .   the single prawn was large and equal in quality to the fresh prawns i had just tasted in new zealand plus the fennel added more flavor .   the tartine of bouillabaisse was mostly small shrimp but again very tasty and tempting to order a bowl the next time around .   the three medjul dates with sausage / bacon   was an unusual combination to my culinary experience and superb in flavor .   the select wines were about half the normal price and a definite value at $ 5 per glass .   in talking with the waiter i noticed there is live jazz on fridays between 5 and 8 .   i will definitely have to return on a friday to try the other tappas and listen to the swedish singer who sings some songs in german ... see tappas photo ... 

 update 4 - 25 - 08 - happy hour season ended this week ... tappas special   no longer available but the thin crust pepperoni makes a good starter .   entrees are in the $ $ $ range ..."
2,"stopped here for lunch with my bff today . 

 nowhere to park , forced to valet , meh ... 

 love the atmosphere here : classy decor , beautiful patio . everything on the menu looked delicious . i had a hard time choosing between many foods that i love : crab cakes , goat cheese , crepes ... i wanted something lighter so i ordered the oriental chicken salad . in the meantime , our drinks were brought to the table . bff pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it . the question is : who left it there ? do n't know . gross . this was pointed out to a server ( not ours because she had not returned to our table ) . our server brought out a new iced tea . she was polite , but not necessarily apologetic . 

 when our meal was delivered to the table , bff pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich ( she asked for no tomatoes ) . the server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate . she came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out . so , i sat with my salad and waited to eat until bff got her meal ( it took a good 5 - 10 minutes for her new sandwich to come out ) . 

 bff raved about the dressing on her side salad . my salad was fine , but nothing to rave about ( especially not for $ 13 ) . the ingredients were fresh but the "" shredded chicken "" that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast . to be honest , i prefer shredded chicken which is why i had decided on that particular salad . disappointing . 

 the server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert . we replied , "" no , thank you "" . and she said something like , "" oh , come on , are you sure ? "" . again , we declined but i really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch . 

 the topper ? 1 valet guy and 6 people in line to pick up their cars = a 10 minute wait just to leave the place . 

 i would hesitate to come back , but that menu is just so damn tempting ."
2,"if cowboy ciao is the best restaurant in scottsdale then cafe carumba has to be just about the worst . this place is terrible . i went here with my family , and not a single one of us enjoyed our meal . the "" handmade chips and salsa "" were clearly store bought , and each of our entrees were consistently , blah . nothing new or intriguing about any of their dishes , and the food just was n't all that great . 

 with so many great choices in old town , why would anyone ever eat here ?"
4,best corned beef sandwich i 've had anywhere at anytime . definitely great portions of food . the jewish sliders are very good especially with the potato pancakes . too bad they are n't in california because i can see myself visiting this a lot .
4,"i recently visited olive and ivy for business last week , and after 3 visits , i am convinced that fox restaurants has some of the best establishments in the valley .   olive and ivy is the fox restaurant of choice for consistently good food , great drinks , and most of all , outstanding service .   i spend a lot of time in various restaurants across the valley and am always amazed at how bad service can be at some of the more popular valley restaurants .   not olive and ivy .   from the first phone call for reservations , to the greeting upon walking in the door to the smiles and warm reception you receive from every server you cross , this restaurant knows how to make you feel special . 

 many of the reviews here will focus on the food and i could spend hours talking about my experiences but i will sum it up in a couple of my favorites . 

 i hate dates and prunes , but the bacon wrapped dates are crazy good ! 
 the shrimp and risotto main course is one of the best dishes i have tasted since arriving in phoenix 3 years ago .   and hands down , their short rib entree is best in the valley . 

 the only catch is the cost .   olive and ivy is not cheap and definitely not for brothers looking to execute the cheap date .   with wine , apps , and main course , you will easy break the century mark , and if you are really being generous , $ 200 is obtainable .   but , it 's worth every dollar and who knows , you may even get breakfast out of the deal !"
2,"my nephew just moved to scottsdale recently so me and a bunch of friends brought him here to show him a local bar that he and the girlfriend could come shoot pool , watch football , play volleyball etc ... well .... we were n't there 5minutes and 2 kids were running around the pool tables , messing up our games and screaming . i could n't believe the staff was allowing this to happen . they were hitting the pool sticks on everything and crying when their mom attempted ( in vain ) to quiet them . you 'd think the mom would leave at this point with her   kids .... um ... no .... the staff did seem annoyed as well but said nothing . then .... it happened ... she said "" you guys better behave or mommy will be fired "" ! ! holy shit .... she works there ! ! even worse ! shame on that owner for allowing this to happen . and that employee needs to recognize this ... you work at a bar ..... not a daycare .... a bar ! ! !"
5,"4 - 5 locations .. all 4.5 star average .. i think arizona really has some fantastic pizza options , and spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list .. the semi sweet sauce is addictive , great service , fresh ingredients , the spicy italian is my favorite ... the chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs , that make your body parts""romantic "" when you think of their cookies .. btw 5:30pm , on a tuesday , when we left , a 30 minute wait .. its on the list .."
